I had cleaning, bleaching and veneers. I am absolutely delighted with the results. All of the treatment was pain free and appointment times were very flexible which is useful in my line of work.

I strongly recommend the doctor but u have to wait but the waiting time is worth..,Basically I visited the doctor because of my increase in self awareness and anxiety which increased in the last 3 years. Puberty hit me hard which led to mastrubate once every day when in my 15 s and 16s without using lubricant. In my mid 15s I visited a general physician for consultation. He assured me that my glans were 'normal'. But even after that my brains never stopped intriguing about visiting a dermatologist specialising in genital related problems . Towards the middle  of my 18 th year I found Dr. Hari Shankar in practo. He also after examination told me the same thing what the general  physician told that was 'Natural and normal' . He told that my condition could be a mix of non-lubricated mastrubation and natural pigmentation.

I shared with him that the medications had failed to bring me relief from Piles. The doctor recommended that I should undergo laser treatment as soon as possible. He explained me the benefits of laser treatment over the common surgeries. I felt relieved when I got to know that there will be not cuts and wounds on the body in the laser treatment. I felt surprised that the solution to my painful condition could be this simple. My treatment experience at the hospital was also free from any troubles. The infrastructure of the hospital was good and my private room was also very hygienic. The food provided to me in the hospital was fresh. Overall experience at the hospital was good and the staff took good care of me.,My sister was diagnosed with gallstones after eatiing a lot of  junk food. She thought it was due to kidney stones. She took pain killers and that it didn't help . I searched for it's treatment at nearby clinics and found Pristyn care  and booked an appointment with Dr. Arun Mozhi who is a famous doctor in chennai. After her reports from the doctor arrived, we came to know that the pain was due to gallstones and it needed an urgent surgery otherwise it would need to be removed by opening her up. We immediately booked for the surgery and the doctor gave us time for the next day. The surgery went smoothly. The pain was very much less than before and the doctors and the staff were excellent. After a week, the pain went completely away. All thanks to pristyn care, would definitely recommend .,One of my close friends is a heavyweight lifter. One day he felt a bulge in the left of the scrotum and got to know that he was suffering from a hernia. He tried pushing it inwards but that didn't help. After recommendations from some of his friends from medical field, he took the appointment at Pristyn Care hospital in Porur, Chennai. He talked to the doctor and a date for the surgery was fixed. The surgery went very well and there's been no problem at all since then. He is relaxed and fit now. ",500,Dr. C Arun Mozhi Varman,,General Surgeon

Cloudnine Hospital,Chennai,"DGO, MD - Obstetrics & Gynaecology, DNB - Obstetrics & Gynecology, MBBS",33,"The first time i met doctor was at cloud nine for my delivery. I was to meet 2 to 3 doctors before finalising one for my delivery. The meeting with her at cloud nine just made me decide that Yes She is The one.. She will be my gynaec. I was so impressed, comfortable and happy to have Dr. RAJASRI to take care of my pregnancy. She explains everything in detail very patiently, she sticts to her work ethics, very professional,no hanky panky, no trial and error, she diagnosis any problem very fast and it is always right. From the begining she has always insisted on Normal Delivery for me. Usually todays doctors just leavenit on patients whatever they want to do, c section being the easier way out but Dr.Rajasri stuck yo her words and principles and did a normal vaginal delivery for me. She is one doctor who treats all her patients with highbimportance and priority and she never prescribes or advices to have medicines unnecessarily. Throughout she had prescribed only 2 medicines during and post pregnancy though i am a case of PCOD. Her confidence is just too good and thats what i love about her. She knows exactly when to do what. Her confidence in the labour room, during my delivery, the entire process of getting my baby out till the sutures, was just too good. She is exxellent at her job, no complaints at all. Even my sutures post delivery has healed so beautifully, my uterus is back in its place, body feels good and back to normalcy. , She has been a Second MOTHER to me throughout my journey of pregnancy. Yes. She is a bit strict, which if she was not then i wouldnt have had such a smooth delivery. I must say she is a blessing to all MOM TO BE ladies. No one can ever look back and complain anything wrong about Dr.Rajasri because she treats every one of her patients as if they are herbonly patient. My water broke and i was admitted in cloud nine at 6.30pm in the eve, i delivered only the next morning at 4.51am , and doctor was with me throughout. She stayed that night in the hospital. From 8.30pm to next norning 10am she was very much there to check on me. Just before my delivery , evey one hour she used to come to and check on the pain and my contractions. I have never seen such a doctor who spends so much time with her patient. Doctors only come at the time of delivery is what i have seen at other places. But Dr.Rajasri, thankyou so much for being there for me, and thankyou so much for a smooth delivery and for being my doctor,my guide, counsellor, advisor and being like my MOM throughout my journey of pregnancy. If it was'nt for YOU, then i woudnt have had a SMOOTH NORMAL DELIVERY WITHOUT ANY COMPLICATION AT ALL. Thankyou once again and if i come across any mom to be i will surely direct her to you only. Dr.Rajasri as a person is so calm, soft spoken, very understanding,very good at making patients understand about everything, very professional, very disciplined, very principle oriented,very optimistic and always gives us the positive vibe and ALWAYS SMILING WITH CONFIDENCE. Anyone who wants a Normal Delivery must must go to her. Thankyou Doctor Once Again., I visited her for my delivery during the last few months of my pregnancy. She is very practical, straightforward and gives the best guidance to a patient. Her decision making based on patient history and treatment options were perfect and it led to the smoothest possible labour for me. Definitely will recommend her 100%. Thank you Dr.Rajasri, To the point, no unwanted  talks. Absolutely no waiting time in the clinic if you book your appointments. Takes all the time to explain and clear the doubts of the patients. Extremely practical, no sugar coated talks. To everyone I meet and talk about my pregnancy, I give all the credit to my Dr. God. In simple words, just blindly listen to what Dr says, you‚Äôll have a perfect smooth pregnancy ending in a normal delivery. Thank you so much Dr. You mean so much to me in my life. ,We were enquiring for a doctor who would prefer Normal delivery / Vaginal delivery and we came to know about Dr Rajasri. When we first visited her in 3rd month of pregnancy, We saw the intent (to go for Normal Delivery) from day one. If you are at the clink at the time of your appointment, there wasn't any waiting time at least on one occasion, thanks to their systematic approach in fixing and handling appointments. Dr Rajasri was never in a rush mode. During all our visits, She spent no less than 30 mins during each visit. She was more than willing to give quality time to the patients and she will not take leave of you without making sure the patient has got all the clarifications. She doesn't recommend any unnecessary medicines and gives us sensible advises. She has a humane touch and builds good rapport with the patient and understands the patient completely during each visit.

THANK YOU DOCTOR for your utmost care.,Hi all...Dr. Sajai is a wonderful dermatologist our family came across in recent times. I had booked an appointment with Dr. Sajai to consult regarding a penile lesion for my father-in-law. After a careful examination, he diagnosed my father-in-law of a dermatologic condition, and started an effective treatment regime for the same. What differentiates Dr. Sajai from many of the other doctors is his patience in explaining each and every treatment modality in complete detail for the welfare of the patients. He also uses diagrams to explain where needed so that patients can clearly visualize the problem/solution. He takes all these extra efforts to ensure that each of his patients will achieve maximum results from a given treatment option. He also devotes a special time to answer all your questions during consultations, and has never rushed our appointment time because another patient may be waiting. Where required, Dr. Sajai has never hesitated to consult with other specialist doctors so that due justice is done to the health of the patient. This happened with our case, where due to unsatisfactory progress with his treatment option, he proactively suspected another disease condition for my father-in-law, and sought opinion from a general surgeon regarding a biopsy assessment. Thanks to his proactiveness, the biopsy revealed a key finding for my father-in-law at a very very early time! Now, our whole family is thankful to him for his shrewd medical judgement, and we would like to continue receiving his expertise for the welfare of my father-in-law.

I discontinued. I just felt she could have kept me informed rather than not responding to me. but she is great at wht she does as per my first experience.,Dr. Anya is very professional, apart from some of the psychologists I have approached in the past. She patiently hears you out and takes time to carefully conceptualize and chart out a unique treatment plan suitable for the client. Her patience was comforting because I never felt rushed or pressured to do anything I wasn't ready for. I would highly recommend her to anyone out there considering therapy but have been unsure either because of a dissatisfactory past experience with a therapist or because of the general hesitation that comes with approaching a mental health professional. ,I've found Anya to be friendly and approachable. She does not jump to inferences, and hears out the client well. She explains concepts in a clear and relatable way, often using analogies the client is familiar with. She does not rush the change process and is patient, while not hesitating to call out counterproductive behavior.,my first session with Ms.Anya was good. She seemed to understand my problem and let me speak freely. I was supposed to meet her after a week for the next session, she sends me a text about 3 hours prior to my appointment saying that she will have to reschedule our session. I was okay with that. But after that I was just not able to reach her till date.. She's not responding to any calls or texts and she just didn't care to inform me that she isn't interested in continuing the sessions.

Suman Clinic,Chennai,MBBS,28,"                   As this was my first pregnancy I wanted the Doctor to be experienced and easily approachable. My search ended up in Suman clinic and with Dr Sumana there whom was recommended by my colleague. I found her very soft natured and listens to our concerns very carefully during every visit. She never prescribed me any extra medicines apart from the calcium and iron supplements. During my visits to her I always insisted for an NVD and accordingly she advised. Finally one night when I faced fluid discharge I.e., 26 days prior my due date I called up her clinic and the duty doctor referred me to Apollo women hospital. There everything was ready on my arrival and Dr sumana spoke to me on phone and asked me to wait for the delivery to be normal. In not more than 4 hours I delivered a beautiful princess in presence of Dr sumana. Thanks Doctor for making my pregnancy a beautiful experience. ,My mom is having post meno pausal problem which later found cysts in the uterus in our area kolkata doctors said there is no hope for this patient but Mam Dr Sumana Manohar she is one person gave a second life to my mother she is the best doctor i have ever seen from 6 am to 6 pm she always there for the patients she is a very resposible doctor and explains complicated problem in a simple way .

I met with many gynaecologist of West Bengal and in other state of india. All the doctors said that nothing is to be done in this case. With time size of fibroid and the baby were growing simultaneously. So in future,there could have been life risk for baby and myself. I was very much upset. Then I came to Dr. Sumona Madam's name. I took appointment and met with her. She advised me to do some tests. After going through the report she advised that the fibroid can be removed easily keeping the baby safe. Earlier I did not believe this. Because I had already consulted with many gynaecologist in india. But I did not have other option. Sumona madam was very much confident. Her confidence about the surgery gave us a light of hope. We were agreed and the operation was done successfully, the fibroid was removed keeping the baby totally safe. Within 18 hours of completion of operation i was able to walk alone and was discharged from Apollo within 24 hours of operation. Dr. Sumona madam is really goddess to us. So if any one has any gynaecological problem do meet with Sumona madam once. She is an excellent doctor and has expertise in surgery.  Dr. Sumona madam will definitely advice you the best remedy for you problem. In my case no doctor adviced me that the fibroid can be removed even in pregnancy to safe mother's life.

Parvathi Nursing Home,Chennai,MD - Physician,13,"Absolutely amazing experience! We are new to Chennai and live in Padur (near Kelambakkam). My wife got very a high fever last weekend and when paracetamol stopped working, I had to find a doctor. We first went to Chettinad Health City - five doctors (looked like interns) came around asking the symptoms and all five had a lost look on their face. I lost it when the fifth one asked me to get the file made before he can proceed. We walked out and went to Swaram Hospital in Kelambakkam. Not a great place but since we had an emergency, it was our only option. Moreover, I didn't want to be robbed by the fancy of Apollo and Global Heath City - the only two other known hospitals within 20 KM of Padur. The medication recommended from Swaram didn't seem to be working and on Tuesday, I was desperate to seek another opinion. Not knowing where else to go, I took her to newly opened Apollo Hospital on OMR (near Perungudi). The OPD doc wasn't available and to out surprise, the emergency doc gave me the standard Apollo bullshit and within first five minutes, gave out an opening script about admitting her for at least two days! This is when he hadn't even checked what the real problem is! I lost it and asked him to give her a paracetamol injection and be done with it. These morons have absolutely no respect for their profession, all they want is to mint money out of you. The doc at Apollo (Bhaskar) had the balls to ask me where do I work? How is that relevant? So that you can mind money out of me depending upon how much I make? To top it all, the doc gave her a paracetamol IV instead of a simple injection and charged me INR 1000 for the 20 minutes we were there. ,He is very nice person and took more care, very next day I suppose to travel, he understood that as wel and gave more attention and he listen everything patiently and noted down al my issues, and slowly started explaining everything in detail, he was trying to educate, normally no one do that. Surprisingly he covered laws of attraction and he wrote nice affirmations and gave to me. He spent more time to explain I never expected this. And finally he charged very less, when compare to the information I received its nothing. I strongly recommend everyone to utilize him, and have a healthy and wealthy life. thank you.,He is very patient enough to listen and examine thoroughly.He explained everything and made me realise that all I have in my mind are myths. My purpose of visit is fulfilled. I am leading a happy life with his inputs. I suggest everyone personally not to read too many articles in internet and confuse yourself. Just consult a doctor and clarify things. It's never late.Thanks Dr. Sridev. ,Good that I read the reviews before I met the doctor but I also had a doubt whether this is just a marketing technique to woo people in the form of paid reviews. I must admit Dr Sridev is a kind person who patiently listens to your health issues and gives you an insight on your medical condition. I visited the doctor with fear of having serious Sexual infection but all my fear and negative thoughts had gone of with doctors advise. He reads your mind well and analyze your body condition before prescribing any medication. Until this day, I have never felt such a doctor experience in my life. Let his knowledge, wisdom and healing techniques benefit people of all walks of life. ",500,Dr. Sridev Barathan,5.0,Sexologist

But she stayed a strong support and immediately suggested few home programs to start with and we did so. I believe she is the only person in Southern India (not sure about the rest of India) to come up with this integrated therapy classes (Occupational therapy + Sensory therapy + Speech therapy + Special Education). Because we are basically from Bangalore and we heard therapist there appreciating this kind of integrated classes, which is not there anywhere. The benefit of the integrated therapy classes is that each therapist can know how the kid is improving collectively across all areas. This helps them to set clear goals and work towards it. We took this integrated therapy classes for my son during the summer holidays for a month and we could see a drastic improvement in him. Since then based on her advice we are continuing with different therapist in Bangalore, but still we come to Chennai to check the progress of my son and guidance from her. Now my son is about 4 yrs old and he has shown tremendous improvement in terms of speech, behaviour, and studies. We can completely vouch for Dr Sai Sucheetra and for her treatment.

I went to many doctors but all were trying to change the brand only.. rather dint fine what her problem was.. Doctor only identified diagnosed and told us. When we went there my baby was 5 months old. She was underweight also. Only because of Doctor. Dhanasekhar she is doing very good now. She is 1.9 years old. I trust him blindly. God bless you doctor !!! Hearty prayers!! ,Well it would take sometime for me to put together my experience. My son has cow's milk protein allergy. This was diagnosed only by Dr. Dhanasekar and none of the other doctors did. He used to posset too much after feedings and the most experienced doctor whom I was consulting (Dr. N. Srinivasan) in mylapore advised me to give domstal between every feeds without having the idea of what my son was actually suffering from. When I approached that doctor to suggest an alternate formula milk for my son, since I had to resume office after maternity break, he suggested to give aavin milk in a diluted form. When I tried this without knowing the underlying cause of my son's excessive possetting, he had severe bouts of vomiting and became drowsy...we rushed him to the doctor and he diagnosed and said my son has to admitted and given IV and if the vomiting doesn't subside he said a scan needs to be taken for further diagnosis. I was in an utter shock but by God's grace my son recovered automatically after the milk was digested. He put my son on another formula and when we tried that again the same scary vomiting episode. This time the doctor was very cool, asked me to give him domstal and try another formula. He would have prescribed almost all the formula milks available in the market to try one after another. Also my son had itchy rashes around his eyes which is a very typical symptom of CMPA (which I wasn't aware that time) and when I asked that doctor, without even examining he gave a very quick answer that it is a birth mark. The possetting episodes never stopped and I was not at peace and hence started researching and found all about this allergy and was again researching on a good doctor who would treat this kind of infant problems. and that's When I found Dr. Dhanasekar and he has to be thanked a million times. When we first time walked into the clinic he doctor at the very look of my son said he is suffering from CMPA and he put me on an elimination diet ie a diet free from milk and milk products first and observed a few days and eliminated some more stuff which could be causing the allergies and thereafter my son's possetting and eczema (rashes around his eyes) started curing off. A big thanks to Dr. Dhanasekar for his services. He is a boon to the medical industry. He spends ample time for each patient and he is a passionate pediatrician. A doctor who matches international standards. A great doctor really.,This was our first visit with Dhanasekhar sir, and I am totally taken aback by this experience. I personally believe that Doctors are real life Heros of our lives. Being a doctor is a noble job, their professional expertise and personal touch is priceless and Dhanasekhar sir is one such person. We all have that feeling/experience/impression when we meet and interact with someone for the first time, and I believe that it's more than enough to testimony for them and the impression which doctor left is remarkable. Be it the ambience (crafted for kids, of course he is a pediatrician, but how many does that),,his experience which he carries is evident in every conversation, the way he inquires/probes/diagnos and understands us and the suggestions he provide,the golden rules displayed and  especially the way he handled my 3 Months old daughter, man I was awestruck.

I was very hesitant about the intake of tablet but he explained me the clear reason on why I needed it. After much thinking, I took the chemical treatment he suggested and I was not pretty satisfied for about 15 days post it as I had many more pimples popping up. But it‚Äôs been more than a month now and I don‚Äôt have any active pimples and pretty happy about it. I Just have these ugly red post acne scars to be removed which I will go back and get consulted for the same :) thank you Doctor, thank you ,Since my first consultation, Dr. Sethuraman has been extremely amicable, polite and professional. Also, very rarely do you come cross such a professional team of staff - from the ones fixing up your appointments and following up on your subsequent visits to the ones changing dressings post surgery. They surely have set a very high standard of professionalism and care which personally I think would be very tough for other clinics to emulate. ,I have visited Dr.sethuraman for acne, scar and pigmentation and he is really special than other docters why because the way he treats every patients is incredible! He is explaining the problem in detail and he will guide you what are the procedures you have to undergo further!And about Treatment sure you can trust him because you can see the results which you have not seen before! Please follow the post procedures correctly then you will see a massive results.I will recommend this zi clinic strongly!

Besides, my son's tooth was removed within one hour of this visit (without any noticeable discomfiture) at Alwarpet Dentistree clinic for only half the price, Rs.3,000. What;s more, he is quite fine and healing faster than expected. The laborious input may serve one who is in need of the right place for treatment.,Didn't help..chraged extra.

Madan Homoeo Clinic,Chennai,MD - Homeopathy,29,"I went through my uncle reference Mr.Saravanakumar and now my family members are reaching this homeopathy doctor only for all health issues, from my family itself lot of people got permanent cure for asthma , vecing , skin allergy etc..i personally recommend this doctor for everyone,I am really happy with the interaction we had with the doctor. The confidence he gave in rectifying the problem is really helpful. The only problem we had was the time schedule. It took more than 2 to 2 and half hours post my scheduled appointment ,I have been consulting Dr Jayakumar for the past 9 years at his Adambakkam clinic. In our family we underwent allopathic medicine mostly until we encountered Dr Jayakumar's treatment. I am a rheumatoid arthritis (hereafter RA) patient. I also had claustrophobia. His diagnosis and treatment gradually reduced the pain and swelling that I had due to rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment for claustrophobia was amazing that my whole family could visibly see the improvement and the subsequent cure that his treatment made a difference in my day to day activities. I almost have all kinds of physical problems in me. Though they seem to be minor the treatment that I received from the doctor helped me to cope up with my daily activities with ease and less exhaustion. Everyone who knew him will say that he is friendly and with all smiles. But I would also like to reiterate that he is strict if we do not follow his instructions. Once when my RA factor reached some unbelievable levels and I was having extreme pain in my knee he came to know that I did not follow his instructions and that due to laziness I stopped doing the necessary physical exercises that his physiotherapist taught me. This lead to the pain and subsequent result for not taking the pills increased the RA count resulting in swelling. Well, he scolded me and also made me aware of the seriousness of the disease that I am fighting to live with. Last year our family moved out of that place and before we left I made a visit to his clinic and consulted him for one last time. Now I again have my knee pain, RA cannot be completely cured. But with proper life style i.e. exercises and medicine I can live with it with less or no pain. Now I am looking out whether the doctor is available in our current city too on visiting consultation. Or else I will have to soon make a visit to his clinic.,Iam went to treatment for breast fibroadenamo. Doctor kind character. I reccommend to my friend. No food restriction. Medicine no sidw eeffect.

When I told her my wife's problem she asked to see her. On examining her, she said that she could cure her and that she would try a few sessions of acupuncture & ES. If the muscles respond she would pursue the treatment. The muscles of my wife's face responded to her acupuncture + ES combo that Dr Vinodhini personally administered ending with a gentle facial massage. After about 6-7 months of regular treatment followed by weekly and later fortnightly treatment, my wife's left side face looks similar to the right side. The left side does not look frozen now. One can say that there's 97% cure of Bell's Palsy. Dr Vinodhini is a very competent physiotherapist who has minute understanding of the muscles and nerves functioning and hence knows exactly the places and points where the treatment is to be administered.

We went through a very good experience of baby birth and we are so happy with the entire team. ,I have been married for 4+ years and was undergoing fertility treatment in X hospital for 2 years. I was really frustrated due to back to back injections for almost a year without no change in drugs. Knowing about this hospital through my friend, started consulting dr.subbulakshmi  during mar 2018.she will examine you thoroughly once again through all the hormone tests and get back to u with what we need it.It was exactly after 7 months of her treatment i got conceived.Good thing about her during my fertility treatment is that she will change drugs for every month, answer as many questions we have very patiently and try every step stage by stage with detailed explanation.Most of my OP was in the evening time and seetha sister was too nice to give us updates frequently.

She is very patient and waits for the labour to progress and make you deliver naturally.,Dr. Subbulakshmi was very kind and patient. She always had a smile for everyone and gives off positive vibes. Even though she had a lot of patients to see, she has always answered each question without rushing. A week before birth, she told me that I was well prepared for labor- both physically and mentally, after doing a pelvic exam. Until then, I was scared if I would be able to manage labor pain but that sentence coming from her gave me great confidence. The other team of doctors - Dr Aarthi and Dr Rexlyn were also incredibly friendly and had a cheerful smile during labor too. The nurses were very helpful and sweet during labor and post-partum period. I feel grateful to everyone for helping my daughter come into the world- without much stress. Epidural is available for pain relief. I don‚Äôt know if I would have managed labor pain without epidural. They also let husbands in to the labor ward and it was a great experience for both of us. They insist on exclusive breast feeding and I am told they also have a breast milk bank to help mothers whose milk hasn‚Äôt come in yet.

The doctor was a night duty doctor and she was not available when I entered the causality though the ward boys took immediate care on my child. The emergency doctor came after 15 mins and started asking questions rudely on what was the reason to rush to the hospital at late night hours. I don't know her name , frankly I never felt like asking her name because of her behavior and the way she treated my son that gave us a very bad experience and impression on her  that she should not be a doctor. She was more focused on why we brought the child at late night and kept suggesting us to admit my son before she could even check the vitals. I never expected a doctor to be this rude and so unprofessional. She being a doctor should give the parents some hope instead of making negative comments. I wasn't satisfied with her prescription so I decided to step in the next day to meet Dr. Karthik and he said nebulization is not at all required as he saw there is no veasing for my son whereas the emergency doctor kept suggesting nebulization.

I consulted several doctors, but they misdiagnosed and gave me wrong treatments for about a month. I rapidly lost weight with my health deteriorating each day. That‚Äôs when I heard about Dr. V. Natarajan, a Senior Urologist from Stanley Hospital, Chennai. Going over my symptoms he suggested that I get a CT scan of my abdomen. He meticulously walked me through the scan reports spending close to an hour explaining every medical term in layman‚Äôs term. Looking at my scans and reports he diagnosed that I had Cancer on my left kidney and suggested that I have it removed immediately to prevent it from spreading further. Consulting Dr. Natarajan was an eye-opener about my health status. Until then I was misguided by doctors that it was a urinary infection. I had no idea I had cancer. Amidst all this turmoil, I still felt hopeful and peaceful as I was in safe hands. I requested Dr. Natarajan if he could do the operation himself which he agreed to gladly. I was treated within the next 3 days with all arrangements in Annai Arul Hospital, West Tambaram. Before my treatment he spoke words of affirmation boosting my confidence. The 5 hour long operation was successful, performed with utmost care by Dr.Natrajan and his team. As per his advice I had a biopsy done on the extracted kidney by Apollo Hospitals reaffirming Dr. Natarajan‚Äôs verdict to a T. I‚Äôm grateful to him for being true to his profession - compassionate, kind and patient. The timing of my meeting with the doctor was just right that had I or he delayed, it could‚Äôve been disastrous. I‚Äôve only been getting better since then, gaining calories and feeling healthy. I recently took a PET scan confirming that there‚Äôs no trace of cancer in my body. I‚Äôm glad I was able to overcome this deadly disease with the help of GOD and Dr. Natarajan. I gladly recommend him to anyone going through a similar situation. Such doctors are a rare find these days! He‚Äôs an expert in his field, thorough and knowledgeable. He helps you save time and money, freeing you off emotional turmoil.  Thank you Dr. Natarajan for saving me!!! I wish you great success in all your endeavors.

Finally, without suggesting any major treatments or tests, he provided medication to cure my problem and within 1 week I was fine,I had taken appointment at 8.45.

T on 6th March/2020 uterine fibroid very sincerely and my wife was present well and good..... Thank mam,My birth story goes like this :,Im here to share my beautiful journey on pregnancy.My husband n I are married for 4 years. I had undergone 3 misscarriages due to different reasons. I was consulting a doctor in adayar then. While speaking to one of my friends who is a doctor studying in SRMC, I came to know about Priyanka mam. I then approached her during 2018 Feb. We planned for pregnancy by the month of April following a follicular study. She spoke so soothingly n positively that nothing would go wrong the next time. I gained a lot of confidence because of her. To overcome the fear on miscarrying, was easy coz of her. I luckily concieved the same month. I remember the initial days being extremely hard on me due to bleeding. Took a break from my job and was in appropriate rest till 5 months. Then started walking n yoga with a help of an instructor. Once I reached 38 weeks we planned to get induced due to my history. On Jan 9th night around 10 o clock mam induced pain for me. Around 5 in the morning dilation was only 3 cms. Started walking in the room holding my husbands hands. Adding on some tablets mam checked for the dilation around 11 am, even then dilation was just 3 cms. She then ruptured my amniotic sac for the fluid to flow out. Then my pain increased severely along with injections in drips.Priyanka mam asked me to be confident n happy about gonna see the baby soon. I started screaming in pain for epidural. Took my epdidural around 5cms of dilation by 12:30 PM. Then after managing the little pain was easy. Around 2:30 my cervix was completely dilated and assistant doctor had called for Priyanka mam. Mam arrived so quickly n I started trying to push the baby. Exactly at 2:48, my little one came out with a slender cry after 16 hours of labour. My husband smiled at me with tears in his eyes n said it's a boy. Mam had then done with my stitches. Had a happy feeling that I could deliver naturally. I would have been even better without an epidural, but that's ok... My pregnancy was fun and beautiful .And becoming a mother has been the most rewarding experience of my life .I loved every moment of it and this would not have been possible without such a supporting husband and doctor. Priyanka mam naturally has a lot of positive vibes with her and its thrown on all her patients.Wishing everyone happy labour n parenting. Thanks Almighty.,Very glad to share the birth of my little girl. I came to Dr.Priyanka by my 27th week of pregnancy, bcos i had to switch cities to be with my mom. My pregnancy journey was not smooth till then. I had a polyp (small growth near cervix),frequent urinary tract and vaginal infections. That would mean i was bleeding every other day with so many medications and was advised bed rest due to fear of pre term birth..I was working, managing household,frequenting doctor and scan centers, had mood swings and always had doubts if polyp could cause something bad. And with polyp and bed rest restrictions family thoughts were on early c section.I first consulted our doctor through phone before making a visit. She was really kind to help me clarify my doubts on polyp and UTI. She spoke like a friend and that gave a real boost to me and my family. She asked me to enjoy my pregnancy (which I could not do till then) and I really took all her words to my heart. After week 32 i started with mild walking and stretches. Now I can't believe, I had full term vaginal birth! Baby was born just one day before my expected due! During my labour I couldn't cope up with the pain by the last hour. Tried breathing and other diversions. My husband was supportive as birth partner. Our doc was there reassuring that it is the last lap of my 9 month journey and I can do it. I can surely say, medications can aid but kind words can heal. While I am getting ready for the next phase of my life,I am inspired by our Doctor. True to her name She is really kind, friendly and gave me the positive feeling to take on my pregnancy and a lesson for rest of my life, never lose hope. My words fail here to express myself..Many thanks to almighty and our doctor for being with me. üôèüèº",800,Dr. Priyanka Mehta,4.5,Gynecologist/obstetrician

He examined my shoulder and I had issues in Range of motion and in restoring the shoulder movements as well. I've had 165 degree Range Of Motion in Flexion. He made me achieve 180 degree in 4 visits. I was not able to visit him often, took 2 months gap. At that long gap, it was my 6th month since the surgery, the time he examined my shoulder I've had problems in shoulder blade and in performing external rotation. Therapist in the hospital, where I've undergone the surgery said that the range would be compromised and it's not good to go further to get back the external rotation. But I've always wanted to get back to sports and weight training. Dr. Mahesh is so good in identifying the troubles and focusing more on areas which will do the good. Mentally he prepared me about the progress in the next couple of days and weeks, so I was able to push myself together and I'm seeing the results now. External rotation has been improved well. It's my 7th month, hitting small weights (2,5KG), I could see the progress myself. If you're looking for a therapist, I'd suggest you to have a session. Now, I'm almost recovered, 90% I could say.

Mylai Dental & Implant Centre,Chennai,"BDS, MDS - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery",13,"I had 2 tooth extractions with Dr. Raj Prabhu. This feedback is for first extraction. I am visiting India nearly after 5 years. I had severe toothache and contemplating a dentist visit. This very moment friends and family conveyed that most of the folks will only market RCT. Finally, Dr. Raj Prabhu was recommended by a personal contact and a doctor, who himself is family to us. Reg 23 December 2019 Appointment, I specifically asked for appointment with Dr. Raj Prabhu and not with Dr. Caroline over the phone. Appointment was scheduled for Dr. Raj Prabhu even in practo but was diagnosed by Dr. Caroline. It was an initial let down as recommendation came only for Dr. Raj Prabhu. But, during consultation, Dr. Caroline initially suggested RCT. She was quick to understand that my plans were different. The moment I mentioned Veneers, she could talk about it. This is great. Especially because initially when personal contacts asked few other dentist about Veneers, they did not have any clue. Then I asked Dr. Caroline about Laser Gum Contouring. She said something about the procedure. I raised my eyebrows with disbelief. She was humble enough to say, Dr. Raj Prabhu may be able to give you right advice, you better discuss about laser gum contouring with Dr. Raj Prabhu. Reg 24 December 2019 Appointment, Dr. Raj Prabhu did my extraction. It was the most pain free dental procedure I ever had in my life. As I have been living in West for more than a decade, I have a practice of visiting dentist for Scaling regularly. Hygiene standards of the extraction was at par with Western World Dental Care. As far as this extraction is concerned, I recommend Dr. Raj Prabhu. But I do not approve the practice of scheduling appointment with one doctor and providing consultation with another doctor. This is my feedback for first extraction. My feedback for second extraction is written separately.,Clinic well maintained, Staff courtesy and Raj Prabhu was patient answered all my queries, he is friendly.,painless treatment and also very friendliness .very clean with a pleasent ambience.,On the first hand Dr. Raj Prabhu was kind enough in accommodating my questions regarding the tooth extraction process. ",300,Dr. V Raj Prabhu,5.0,Dentist

I was in denial and refused to meet with a psychiatrist convincing myself that nothing was wrong with me. When things got out of control, I visited Dr. Shabeeba on the recommendation of a friend and this was one of the best decision I have taken. She was very approachable and easy to connect even at the first visit. She has the ability to patiently listen to my entire story all the while comforting that what I was going through was completely normal. Sometimes in life you need that third person, apart from your family members, to listen to the mental stress you are going through without any judgements. Dr. Shabeeba provided me with that. Her counselling sessions are very good. She does not rush through her procedure. She started me on medications with regular counselling and I definitely found a change in my mood. I was able to care for my baby better. To all those women who might be having symptoms of depression after child-birth, please get help and I strongly recommend Dr. Shabeeba for this. She definitely brought a change in my life.",800,Dr. Shabeeba Z Kailash,5.0,Psychiatrist

That's when I found ABCD and doctor Mr. Vanchinathan. Thank god i finally found the right person. He is highlhighly skillful, multitalented and has vast experience in this field. His uniqueness is that he personally teaches for each and every children here full time and takes complete ownership for their growth. He is teaching my son to improve his learning skills for his academics and the way he teaches is simply awesome with other therapies required for him. I highly ..highly... recommend to all parents who are looking for a best occupational, learning disabilities, speech therapist in Chennai. ABCD is one stop solutions for various need for your children, Its worth taking your children here and dont look for the distance if you are located far from this place. I rate the doctor 5 out of 5.,My Son is receiving occupational Therapy from Mr. Vanchinathan for last two months. He has very good experience in this field and his technique in handling the child is unique and most importantly he gives OT in front of parents which is much better when compared to other centres where parents are not aware of what OT is been given to their kids or what is happening inside the room.I'm really happy with the way things are going now for my child, I feel the therapy given by him is taking my son in right direction. ,He is the only OT specialist who we met in Chennai who hardly spent 5 to 10 minutes asking us name of the child and basic demographics details and charged 500 rupees for what he calls 'Assessment'. He didn't talk to our child for a second. I never knew you can make easy money like this... Great eye opener.. He has zero machinery for OT and can hardly explain his training approach. Absolutley looty for already distressed parents. I am sure you would appreciate that I need not go beyond the first step in this case.,Two years back we met him and after his accessment. We get clear view of our child, from that day we started sessions and we are seeing lot of improvement in our child's studies. Thanks Mr. Vanjinathan.",300,Mr. Vanchinathan,,Occupational Therapist

I was also satisfied about how she suggested some home remedies instead of medicines and also helped with feeding positions as a lactation consultant would do. However introduction of naan and solid foods advice could be better. By 2 months I was told to introduce naan as top up bcoz feeding time was very long - 20 to 40 mins. By 4 months I was told that ideal breastfeeding time is only 5 mins else it means that the baby is not getting sufficient milk. Baby's weight gain n pee counts were very good n indicated sufficient mother's milk. I was adviced to start solids by 4.5 months n I was given sachets of ragi porridge and rice porridge sold by a vendor. I feel a doctor should not advice packed foods n should be strict about only giving moms milk and home made porridge. All other doctors I saw later said it's very common for babies to feed for 40 to 50 mins and I can wait to complete 6 months for starting solid food. ",300,Dr. Smitha Kumar,4.0,Pediatrician

Emerging Fit Physiotherapy & Rehab Center,Chennai,"BPTh/BPT, MSc. - Physiotherapy",13,"Most Hospitals / Clinics are places where one finds people - Doctors , Staff and Patients - with serious faces. Not at 'Emerging Fit' . Dr Radhika Bharath and her team make the place and the entire experience, lively and cheerful. Not that she tells only nice things that patients want to hear. She can be quite blunt when she finds a patient not following the treatment plan as instructed. And her treatment certainly worked fine. The results were quite visible. I wish all healthcare places were as cheerful.,Initially I was taking treatment somewhere else, and every time I use to go they use to give me IFT and Ultrasound, and some physical exercise. It continued till one month 15 sessions approx but I didn't feel any relief. Fortunately one day I got in touch with Dr. Radhika and started my treatment here. After couple of sessions I started feeling relief and in 9 to 10 sessions I was relieved from my pain completely. During this treatment she never used IFT, ultrasound was used 2 or 3 times, it was more of physical exercise which I was been advised to do on regular basis. Highly professional and well trained. The staff at Emerging fit Divya and Sangeeta are courteous towards patients. ,Its the place where we gain more energy. If anything hurts during exercise we don't mind because Rathika is there to take care us. Its a good place where we get positive energy and good feelings. When I miss the classes I feel very bad. Its the only place where I get close with many people. Saturday classes are very good and I enjoy them a lot expect skipping. I am recommending this place for my near and dear ones as its gives fitness to our body and mind. I wish I should come here for long time without any breaks. Thank you Rathika for giving us such a place to transform ourself. ,Immediate identification that the root cause is due to less water consumption, poor ergonomic posture while at work. Treatment to release muscles was effective and this was followed by core strengthening sessions regularly. That made my core stronger and now am feeling more confident that i will not get those pain again.

Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital,Chennai,"MBBS, MD - General Medicine, DM - Gastroenterology",9,"I had taken my 87 year old aunt to Dr. Sibithooran since she was ailing.  He was extremely friendly and approachable and was kind enough to explain the entire treatment procedure in layman terms.  The confidence he gave was tremendous and we believed that he would give his best.  While the procedure was over by around 7 PM, he stayed back till midnight to ensure she is back to normal especially as she was given general anesthesia.  A couple of times, when I needed some clarification, he was ready to give me a patient hearing and respond to queries, even between his busy OP schedule.  The faith on a doctor itself contributes towards quicker recovery.  ,I actually had acid reflex problem, so went and consulted him ,mentioned that i have GERD problem, so he recommended to have Endoscopy, after endoscopy he will confirm actually kind of acidity issues and i need to have medicines to stop the problem reoccurring and I am taking those medicines and i could see which is some what reduced now and he also recommended to have one more endoscopy next month so that he can confirm the problem got reduced. I have been consulting him for past 2 months and the 1 time did endoscopy and the second time consulted just to know more details about the problem, both times he was supportive and like prod and feedback. Definitely happy with the doctor treatment and consultation, Hospital facilities were good and i could find all the equipment's were good.

Life Healthcare Multi Specialty Rehabilitation Centre,Chennai,"BS - Psychology, MSc - Applied Psychology",5,"The treatment methods are good, useful and helpful. The goals of the treatment and the nature of problems need to contracted like enhanced self concept, reduction of self destructive/acting-out behaviour, increased trust, reciprocacity, emotional closeness to parents etc. Clear and concrete goals which are framed positively, stated in specific to behavioural terms, realistic and achievable need to be contracted to achieve a sense of ownership, to achieve motivation. Developing an understanding of the problems is essential and a belief that it can be solved is essential. It determines responsibilities and roles. Reframing problems as goals will help reduce perception of helplessness by establishing realistic goals. As the therapist attributes the person's success to her own efforts, feelings of inadequacy and negative self image will be reduced, the client can now perceive herself in positive light. It facilities accountability and self esteem. It promotes positive relationship with a focus on willingness to accept and comply with behaviours and goals within the context of a relationship. This will make the therapy whole, will remove a state of helplessness, increase self-esteem/confidence as the goals are achieved, will help to take accountability to regulate emotions rather than acting-out, will enable to see the client in positive light and removes self doubt ( I can change , I can be in control, I can be determined, and I can live positively, I can form relationships without people running away from me) ,I'm a studious student when I was 10th std...with confident and brave...after joining a international hostel with a fire to get top Marks in 12std..But I was bullied and had a homesick and due to teachers partiallity I was in mental depression with fear of facing and  touching books and even for facing people...I went to 2 psychiatrist and they get lots of money in the name of treatment but nothing happened and my father lost the hope on me...no one is there to guide me but many were there to criticize me ...even my father mother and sister...no one helped to overcome my fear or no one is there to support and guide me to overcome my fear..I was very much in depression and stress...as a ambitious girl and had a fire of getting success in my life but I cant overcome my fear and suffered a lot...at last with a hope on God...I searched a psychologist here...and i got wonderful psychologist her name is Ananthi in life health care hospital..she seems to be God to me  ..my heart is filled with gratitude for her...seriously with 3 days I overcome my fear...if u guys believe me or not that's true...she gave lots of therapy and she guide me a lot.. even when I call at 12 am at midnight she use to response without any hesitation ...she gave lots of homework and assignment and motivation ..I have 2 months for my 12th exam...now I gained confidence and interest definately I will get good Mark in my 12th..now I had hope that after 2 years break I overcome my fear and I will join the college in July.. thanks to Dr.Ananthi mam.. who changed my life ...at last God helped me through her...,Ananthi doctor was very polite , kind and friendly.

Dr. Shaji Bharath patiently listened to all my problems and diagonised the issue properly. Doctor gave simple lifestyle/diet tips and started the treatment, after 1.5 months my GERD and digestive problems are almost resolved (which was with me for 2 years). I would recommend this doctor and the hospital for their friendliness and positive atmosphere. ,I have only done one treatment/consultation, have found him to be very kind, genuine,So have decided to take treatment from Dr.Shaji Bharat for the next 3-4 months. I have known about acupuncture for a while, it can be very useful in many circumstances where western medicine has no cure. I have a bunch of health issues and knew I needed something like acupuncture a year ago. I didn't try it then since the only easily available treatment center I found in Chennai through google search had quite expensive packages. Very thankful to have found Dr.Shaji who is a healer/doctor with good ethics. He is very down to earth and charges reasonably. Thank you doctor for making acupuncture accessible to more people!,I have completed six sessions in the last few weeks. The acupuncture treatments alongside a low carb diet has helped me lose 8 kilos in such a short time. Diet alone is sometimes not enough, especially when you have a lot of weight to lose. A holistic approach is needed. I‚Äôm continuing my treatment with Dr.shaji for the next few months and is excited for the results. I highly recommend this doctor for any health concerns you may have.,Dr Shaji has been treating me for Rheumatoid Arthritis for the last 3 months. I went to him in a very bad condition with stiff joints and could not move my wrist and hand.Dr Shaji gave me the confidence that my condition will soon improve and  likewise I already feel the difference in just 3 months. I have suffered for years in pain and thanks to Dr Shaji's treatment, I am painfree and have stopped taking my painkillers after years. He is extremely approachable and  gives his patients a lot of positivity and hope.

Ponmalligai Hospital,Chennai,"BSc - Dietitics / Nutrition, MSc - Dietitics / Nutrition",9,"My counselling is for Weight loss and She gave a chart for my weight reduction (which i gained after a minor surgery). She is too professional and completely understood my physical problem and charted a excellent diet plan with right mix of physical activities (subjective to individuals based on ages and health). It worked out well and I gradually lost my weight from 92Kgs to 75Kgs over a period of 15 months as she insisted that i can shed weight in natural method.,Anusha has been an integral part of my weight loss journey. We had a detailed conversation about my goal and the hurdles I have to face during the journey. Anusha has been completely supportive and guided me at every stage both technically and emotionally. The diet recommendations were complete practical and easy and cheap to follow. When I wanted to pursue vegan diet, she gave me a green flag and it was super powerful. She is reachable and friendly and has been a main part of whopping 15kg weight loss. I would call her a life - changer. ,We had gone to anusha for diet counselling for weight reduction. What impressed me the most about anusha was, she was regularly in touch with me to know how I was progressing. It was very tough in the initial week and I was about to give up the prescribed diet r√©gime and thats when she stepped in and slightly tweaked the diet that would satisfy my pallet. ,found anusha mam and the clinic quite pleasant. Finally with her  diet, I started losing weight n becoming fit. My case was serious due to which I was put on antideprssants and gained weight, but she really handled it very nicely.For those who have gained weight due to anti depressants dont lose hope .Chnage in diet will help u reduce the weight.thanks to her expert care and guidance",500,Ms. Anusha Santhanakrishnan,4.5,Dietitian/nutritionist

She listens to your concerns patiently and prescribes very good quality/resonably priced products and guides you with a complete skin care regime. Shes even available to answer quick questions or follow ups on call. I definitely prefer her to so many other dermatologists I have consulted with before. My skin has improved a lot since she started treating me and is visibly lighter and spot free. I'd highly recommend Dr.Aishwarya for any skin related treatments. ,I consulted Dr. Aishwarya  in March 2017, initially she prescribed regular skin care treatment, after seeing the results I decided to continue treatment with her. I later started treatment for acne and tan removal though it was very close to my wedding she provided a very good combination that suited my needs and ensured results in very less time. In matter of 2 weeks acne completely reduced and skin obtained a glow. The best part of the treatment was it reduced further breakouts and reduced my dark circles. I would strongly recommend Dr. Aishwarya for skincare treatment if you are looking for value for the money spent and also remarkable results. ",500,Dr. Aishwarya Selvaraj,,General Practitioner

Shiny's Diet Clinic,Chennai,MSc. - Nutrition and Dietetics,5,"Rachel has been an amazing guide who could bring about many a positive results like weight loss, inch loss and an increase in energy levels. What I found most impressive is that she hasn't made any drastic changes in my diet habbit. She has fine tuned my existing diet to best suit my health conditions. I look forward to my review meetings and am glad to have her assistance. I am sure I am going to get even better with Rachel's guidance. The best thing is that it's all scientific and logical. She is able to give reasons why she is making the small small changes she is doing. I am grateful for her support and advices.,Effective without having to starve myself. I recieved a diet plan for weight loss and unlike many diets that i have heard about outside, i didnt have to give up on a lit of my favourite food. And also it was very effective too. I lost weight that i had been having difficulty shedding. And all of this without any exercise as well.  And also the meal plan was satisfying enough that i do not crave anything else. And the doctor is also very friendly and the session feels like discussing dietimg with a close friend instead of a specialist. Would definitely recommend to any who has trouble losing weight.,Doctor was extremely nice. Very encouraging and supportive. Was giving a lot of easy tips to follow during the diet. She was also explaining the reasons why certain food needs to be consumed or avoided. Was helping me to have a proper lifestyle change not being too rigid. Overall a very good experience.

One of my another friend suggested Ms. Alima Zehra for consultation. I had personally accompanied my friend to Alima's place and Alima was so friendly and explained us what could have caused her stress after hearing the problem. Her patience should be appreciated in hearing the problem. Her positive thoughts and speech gave my friend a good confidence and great energetic enthusiasm. I would definitely suggest Ms. Alima Zehra for all my friends who are all under pressure/stress . We will surely go for the next session with her.
