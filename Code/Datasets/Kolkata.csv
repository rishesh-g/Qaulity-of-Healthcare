Mission Smile,Kolkata,BDS,17,"She explained various procedures accurately and pointed out reasons for my gum and teeth problem which I was never explained by other dentists. Overall I think she is a genuine person ,Lying on the dentist's table is a frightening experience. The challenge of the dentist therefore is to earn the trust and confidence of the patient as quickly as possible. After the two sittings  I have so far had with Shruti, I am pleased to say that I feel comfortable with her. Her procedures on my teeth (root canal and preparation for subsequent capping) were carried out flawlessly. She also had maintained good communication with me right through the procedures and helped me relax. The only downside I have to mention is that I found her support staff below par. When asked to hand over an instrument or an accessory, they often took a very long time, which in my experience is very unusual.  This is probably a training and management issue, but it needs the attention of the owners of the clinic.  ,Excellent, Clean,  professional & caring speciality Dental clinic.. ,  Dont ever take the treatment from her. I have visited asthetica clinic for pain in wisdom tooth in 2015 Feb. She has recommend rct on my wisdom tooth, with latest painless technology they had, that too only 2 sittings. I have paid around 15000 for rct of one tooth only. But right after rct, I had so much pain for first week and was feeling uncomfortable, I have visited clinic 3-4 times, everytime she has done xray, and told me everything is fine, then she grinded other teeth on my compliant, but she did nothing about my wisdom tooth pain, this pain u have tolerated for almost 7-8 months by thinking may be because healing will take time. But finally i have visited Cmc Vellore, they have done full mouth xray and told tooth is in very bad situation, immediately extraction is required, then I have visited some other specialist in bangalore, everyone recommend immediate extraction, and has also told that situation is that bad, that no one can guarantee proper healing as rct has created too much infection in gums.

It was really nice feeling when the Dr. a busy man on a Monday took the time out to check in with me instead of the other way around. To me it meant he really cared about me as a patient first. After a week my pain was gone when I visited him. By this time on my 3rd visit Aditya had now become the soft spoken friendly face any patient would want to revisit. He did my final filling under 10mins. He also then proceeded and cleaned my teeth. Being a smoker i had some bad stains which  no amount of brushing removed. However Aditya assured me he would remove the stains and voila after a fairly short cleaning of my teeth, the stains were gone. I would call him a magician if he wasn't a licensed experienced Dentist. Honestly speaking since then I cant get over looking at my teeth in the mirror stain free. Before with the stains I had become self conscious off my stains and use to refrain from opening my lower lip too much while conversing with any one because of the fear and embarrassment of exposing my stains to them. Dr. Aditya not only fully took care of my stains but also gave me back my confidence.Even when I was done with all my visits root canal, filling, cleaning he once again got in touch with me to make sure I was now 100% in matters of my teeth.To sum I would like to say Dr. Aditya Shahabadi is soft spoken and an ideal patient, patients man!! He showed & dully really cared for me throughout . My over all experience of visiting a Dentist now is more of confidence than of apprehension.To any one out there looking for an all rounder dentist & full 360°Dental Experience I would highly recommend you give Dr. Aditya Shahabadi a go, trust me and I speak from experience he will take care of you like your 1 of his own, whether it's your 1st or 5 th visit!! Honestly speaking i dont think you can ask more!!Ps: He is also very reasonable when it comes to the pocket. ,A wonderful doctor as well as a wonderful human being .

He also confirmed that the patient will get instant relief from his ongoing pain after the surgery. The OT went through for 6 hrs and was pretty successful. My father was discharged within 3 days of surgery and his is now quite OK. The doctor is so helpful, understands your problem. He has got kind and polite behavior. He is so easily accessible and entertains you by answering all your queries over phone also. After the surgery when we were at home, he called once and asked for patient’s health condition. This was absolute wonder to us. We need more doctors like him and pray for him huge success in future. Thank you Sir. We are really honoured to have you as a doctor.,Hi... I am Samiran Naskar.

But after surgery I was shocked!! Just within 10 days after surgery my father walked almost 2 km every morning.  And after 20 days he is as normal as like 10 years before.

But in one go he could rule out the  likelihood of carcinoma by just looking at MRCP plates to which my happiness new no bound. Later he advised us for CT Scan in which some problem was suspected and under him my mother was admitted in Medica S Hospital and ERCP & EUS was done successfully. Finally his prediction came true when I was informed by him( later I saw the video also) that it was all due to stone in CBD &  ampula. ,experiences(in my opinion)in GI ailments be it malignant or else because evrything depends upon proper & early diagnosis.

She was prescribed 10 daye of hospital stay But her stay extended beyond 10 days & the doc did not give us any reason.She was undergoing different pathological tests but when asked for reports the doc denied having seen them. We were confused. After 15 days the doc said she would be discharged. Meanwhile my mother looked frail & lost. Her stomach was abnormally bloated. But the doc said that she was fine.on the day of discharge the doc said that as the patient was on liquid diet she should be given 12 feeds through the feeding tube & the rest orally. He also wrote that in discharge certificate. On the day of discharge before going home we asked the nurse to explain to us the procedure of feeding through food tube. The sisters replied that the feeding tube had jammed & become nonfunctional. We called the doc immediatwly. He said he did not know this & asked us to oral feed the patient. We were stunned r. My mother had to be taken home in an ambulance on a stretcher. She was drowsy & looking lost. Her limbs were numb. She seemed abnormally heavy. Her stomach was extremely bloated. But the doc had said she was fine. We took her home on 28th evening. On 29 th after noon she stopped urinating.

AMRI Hospitals,Kolkata,"MBBS, M.Ch - Orthopaedics, MS - Orthopaedics",17,"Dear Reader,Kindly read my review till the end for more clarity about Orthopaedic Surgeon Dr.Manoj Kumar Khemani. Because now it is much needed to say something about him and he really deserves this from me and other patients as well.I Started Consulting Dr.Manoj Kumar Khemani three months back for my neck pain to the left upper limb which I was suffering in the past one and half years. Finally, to get rid of that pain I first met him to get a second opinion, in which this doctor was strongly recommended by one of my colleagues. The best part about him is he makes you feel very comfortable and explains the problem and procedure clarity. however, I feel fortunate to met him at just the right time since it was not a good experience with my previous doctors regarding the same.Anyways Dr.Khemani recommend me to get few blood tests done for diagnose purpose and as a result found that there is major vitamin D3 & B12 deficiency and specially not spondylosis which declared by my previous doctors. After that he recommends me some relevant medicines. Eventually, when I was completely cured after completing two months of medicine course another incident happened. I met with an accident and my left ankle bone got fractured and misplaced with internal bleeding then again I met him and post checking my X-RAY report he suggested to go for surgery ASAP. After that I underwent for the surgery which was successfully done by him and now day by day I am feeling much better and seeing great improvement and hopefully again I will start leading my normal life soon.I am extremely happy with Dr. Manoj Kumar Khemani, I wish him great success in the year ahead. and strongly recommend everyone to consult this doctor for any kind of orthopaedic issues.,His experience is very good. I felt like I am talking to a long-time friend. Dr Manoj paid full attention and listened to each and every word I had to say. I felt like 50% of my problem was gone after talking to him! I have never found any doctor having so much patience. Explained every little thing... Clarified all my small doubts ... I strongly recommend him. I am better with a few sessions of physiotherapy advised by him. The best part is that he gave me no medicines, only vitamins! ,I want suffering from back pain since last 2 years. I went to several doctors. I also did MRI scan but my pain was not ok. I was also told by a doctor that I need operation. Dr. Khemani did some tests and found that I had low vitamin. Thanks to him I am 90% better now. I recommend him.,My mother had an Intra articular distal radius fracture. Dr. Khemani and his team operated her on 23rd of July, Volar plating was done. Yesterday on the 16th day after surgery she could easily hold a glass of water and drink. Dr. Khemani's technical abilities are definitely amazing what makes him stand alone is his amazing smile and such patient friendly behaviour - Both combined definitely results in a super fast recovery. Thank you Doctor!",600,Dr. Manoj Kumar Khemani,4.5,Orthopedist

His sodium level and WBC count were imbalanced. I admitted him at CMRI on 22nd January in ICU. I had no idea under which doctor I should admit him. They suggested me Dr. Suman Mitra. Frankly speaking, at the beginning I had little bit doubt, but now I am helpless without him. Dr. Mitra guided me like a family member. I have never seen a doctor like him, who is so down to the earth. Even he is ready to talk with my mother by phone who is a so called house wife for her mental support. Dr Mitra released my father on 31st March.2nd phase:   Suddenly on 23rd February my father's urine got stuck. The day was Sunday. Another great thing of Dr. Suman Mitra is that he is also available on Sundays. When most of the renowned doctors are not available on weekends. Again he treated my father so generously. And today on 25th February my father is coming home from the hospital. Every time Dr. Mitra called my father as ""baba"". God bless him ,I had taken my father to CMRI after being advised by our house physician about some infection which may have caused through urine. He also had fever at that time.,Dr Suman Mitra was referred by my husband's cousin brother as i have been suffering from frequent cough and colds. The most amazing part was i did not have to wait and the moment we entered his chamber there was a feeling that finally we have got our family doctor. He was very nice to talk to which healed half my ailments. He explained the root cause of my problem and was extremely patient. He has been in constant follow up on Watsapp regarding my health. ,Dr. Mitra is one of the most friendlist reassuring doctors I have met.

Highly recommend him. ,We were visiting India from USA with our 7 month daughter.We had consulted Dr. Jana twice for viral fever and chicken pox. We were pleasantly surprised with his attitude.I think it is fair to say that his level of service surpasses his counterparts in USA. His style of treatment was totally inline with our views. He is a firm believer of giving very less medicine and let our body take care of ourselves.We can't recommend him enough.Great doctor.,Dr. Jana has been treating my son since birth. My son was born one and a half month earlier than the EDD since I was diagnosed with Polyhydramnios. It took utmost care and explained every single thing with immense patience.

She is patient and compassionate and respected my choices. She could really see through me. I am really thankful for her advice. She helped me figure out my future career prospects, which I was very skeptical about. She is a great listener and she replies with insightful comments. After the sessions I became more confident and I really know what I want to study and do in future.,Ruchi has been extremely helpful to me in identifying certain deep rooted issues ranging from personal trauma to questions about confidence, belief and encouraged me in adopting a better lifestyle and gain clarity on multiple issues. I would whole heartedly recommend her because she provided a very safe space for me where I could talk about each and every issue that was bothering me and irrespective of their gravity to me, she took every single one of them with utmost sincerity and care. ,Ruchi has been a lifesaver when it comes to my experience with depression. When I first called her up to enquire about a support group, she was the only one in my city who answered positively. Her laugh gave me a certain kind of hope in the heart and then afterwards, when I met her, I felt even better. She arranged the support group for me and 2 more participants a few months later and it was a truly great experience. I learnt a lot from her. She was friendly, a truly happy soul and very, very helpful. I will recommend her to everyone who's looking for a soul that will listen to them and come up with truly unique, helpful solutions. She is light. ,She is a great guide and I found her very polite and soft spoken person. In all my sessions she gave 100% and was very attentive to all my concerns.

I took her to a renowned orthopedic of this city, who did lot of tests, x-rays, even ct scan with contrast of right shoulder, did not find anything. He suggested few painkillers, none of them helped.

She is well available over phone and whatsapp which is an added boon for most patients. Our pregnancy was not a smooth ride at all due to certain factors.

Sunrays Healthcare,Kolkata,"MBBS, M.D. (Psychiatry), DPM (Psychiatry)",18,"patient communication is a central clinical function, and the resultant communication is the heart and art of medicine and a central component in the delivery of health care. The 3 main goals of current doctor-patient communication are creating a good interpersonal relationship, facilitating exchange of information, and including patients in decision making. ,-patient communication is determined by the doctors' “bedside manner,” which patients judge as a major indicator of their doctors' general competence. communication has the potential to help regulate patients' emotions, facilitate comprehension of medical information, and allow for better identification of patients' needs, perceptions, and expectations. There are many barriers to good communication in the doctor-patient relationship, including patients' anxiety and fear, doctors' burden of work, fear of litigation, fear of physical or verbal abuse, and unrealistic patient expectations.  Prior to meeting Dr Chowdhury, I lived with marginal hope and very limited self-confidence. I could not envision a viable future. Dr. Chowdhury carefully, skill fully, and wisely facilitated my return to a world of self-esteem and self-management. He successfully combined an impressive command of psychopathy meds with an empathic manner. Dr. Chowdhury knows the difference between being a rigid shrink and an empowering professional. He was decidedly the 2nd Doctor who helped me back to my life rather my rebirth! For that, I am profoundly grateful. , He is a caring listener.While you are speaking to him you can see the thoughtfulness in his eyes ,something that is truly a rarity in this world nowadays. The best part of him is he tells you what you need to hear not what you want to hear.  Also, has been able to gently push me to consider some things I wouldn't have on my own, but which have proven to really help. I strongly feel that with Dr. Chowdhury, I have an ally who can help me transform my personal narrative into a fully-lived and realized life.  In short, I recommend Dr. Chowdhury with the highest of praise.,I was really very depressed and tensed, also unable to resolve my problems as well as share with anyone. Literally, I was having typical symptoms of depression. Suddenly,by the sake of God, to consult a doctor came to my disturbed mind. I googled and found Dr. Arijit Dutta Chowdhury on top of the list. Suddenly I decided to opt him as my consultant and went to be treated on the next day. I was very anxious whether it will work or not. But trust me,from the moment I shared my mess with him and he started his therapy I felt better day by day. His care and treatment brought a drastic change in my attitude and activities as well. ,I have visited Dr.Dutta Chowdhury because of my father’s ailing health as he is suffering from Lewy body dementia .Before we visited Dr.Dutta Chowdhury he was undergoing a treatment but I didn’t find any improvement in his health instead it was deteriorating.As soon as my fathers started his treatment under Dr.Dutta Chowdhury I found improvement from the very second day.His diagnostic acumen is amazing and his way of explaining the issue to the patient’s family is very satisfying.His approaches to the treatment is very modern and he is always available to his patients or their family at any point of time Which is very rare gesture.I am really thankful to him for treating my father with so well and with so much care.,MY FATHER HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION SINCE 2005. HE KEEP ON CHANGING DOCTORS FOR BETTER RESULT AND FINALLY AFTER COMING UNDER THE LIMELIGHT OF DR. ARIJIT DUTTA CHOWDHURY I GOT BACK MY JOLLY AND OLD FATHER. ALL CREDIT GOES TO U SIR.

Dental Clinic,Kolkata,BDS,25,"I convey my heartiest thaks to Dr. Suvendu Pal & Dr. Boby Pal. They are very experienced & efficient in the Dental Treatment Field.  I am really satisfied with the treatment of RCT & Scaling by them with a great care. The contemporary dental surgery apparatus & hygienic condition of the chamber is appreciated. Root Canal treatment is the second choice, and the advantage is that it will spare your tooth. Extraction is just a final resort alternative, in light of the fact that a missing tooth prompts various different issues that can have an exceptionally negative effect on your dental wellbeing. Scaling and root planing, otherwise known as conventional periodontal therapy, non-surgical periodontal therapy, or deep cleaning, is the process of removing or eliminating the etiologic agents – dental plaque, its products, and calculus – which cause inflammation, thus helping to establish a periodontium that is free of disease.If you are finding for a good dentist, then you may contact without any delay with Dr. Suvendu Pal in Kolkata for a good treatment.,Both the Doctors are very good. They Jointly Worked on me to did the RCT and Crown. First time I did my rct without any Pain. The Injection given to me was painless.The Clinic is very Hygienic Clean and well decorated. Payment I did by Credit Card.

This has continued for around a week. I have consulted a spine surgeon in Apollo Gleneagles who suggested me an MRI. After looking at MRI report he has advised microsurgical discectomy because of herniated disc. I was reluctant to go for a second operation as I was recuperating from fractured leg operation a fortnight back. I have taken two more opinion, one from a neurosurgeon in AMRI & second from a spine specialist in MEDICA Superspeciality Hospital. After discussion with Dr. Shumayou Dutta my family and my colleague got confidence that things will be alright after the surgery. Dr. Shumayou Dutta has suggested micro endoscopic discectomy which is minimally invasive and recovery period is a day or less. Dr. has taken time to go through my entire report and has made my family understand looking at the MRI plate as where is the problem and the time frame by when I can go for the surgery. In between this time I was also doing my research on the L5-S1 discectomy cases, best hospitals & Doctors in Google. I was quite impressed by the reviews/testimonials & positive feedback of the Patients for Dr. Shumayou Dutta who has many awards & research papers to his credit apart from the professional membership/fellowship he holds on the subject. After getting confidence, I have planned to go for this surgery on 27th March 2019 which went quite well. I have got immediate relief from pain, numbness almost gone and I am having much strength in my leg. Needless to mention the mental relief I have got after this surgery.

We would highly recommend Dr. Dutta for his professionalism and care towards his patients. He has such a friendly personality and takes the time to explain each and every thing to his patients.

Grey Matters Wellness,Kolkata,"MA - Clinical Psychology, PGDPC (Post Graduation Diploma In Psychological Counselling), BA - Psychology",6,"This was my first experience with counseling. It was a good experience. I have always had difficulty with opening up to people and I was pretty scared when I started. Ms Piya's kind and friendly nature made me feel safe and comfortable about sharing my problems. She helped me understand the issues I was facing and gave me tools to cope with them. All the exercises that she has made me do has helped me immensely. She was patient with me, whenever i had difficulty in communicating. She has helped me gain self confidence and clarify the confusions i faced. She is amazing at what she does. I am glad I have her as my counselor.,I had visited Dr Banerjee for my Anger Management problem. I have already completed two sessions and I am highly satisfied. The doctor is really very patient and tries to solve all the problems. I am feeling a bit better nowadays and I hope surely that I will be able to completely control after all the sessions are over. The solutions given by the doctor have really been very useful to me. I hope that I will completely recover after required number of sessions are over. Her tips and advices are really very useful. ,I have never gone for counselling before, but was dealing with severe anxiety and depression this year and wasn't able to figure out exactly why I was feeling so bad. I found Piya on practo and decided to try going. She was able to schedule an appointment with me right away, which I think is really essential when people are in a bad situation. After our first session, I was so happy I had found her. Every session  is interactive, and though I might have been looking for someone to tell me what the right decision would be for certain questions in  my life, she helped me realize that's not really what therapy is. It's about working with someone (and it's work and doesn't just happen overnight!!!) to get to a place where you yourself can have the strength to make your own choices in life and feel like you can trust them whatever the result, and learn from them. She's really helping me  see some things I didn't realize before , and helping me equip myself with the emotional and communication tools to be open to the experiences I want to be open to.  I would recommend seeing her if you know you are ready to feel differently and make a change but don't know of what to do. She will give you homework, but I like it! The work gives me something tangible and real to track my progress with and makes me feel like I'm doing something.  It's true that when changing - a lot of that work has to be done yourself- but Piya is a great guiding voice of support and encouragement during this challenging process. Her openness to feedback and flexibility with different approaches made me feel like I would be totally comfortable talking with her about what's working or not working in the future, and that freedom of communication is really refreshing and I think, unique to her. Again, despite still working through my own worries and insecurities, I'm back to being more of my cheerful self, feeling hopeful, and honestly, feeling very excited to keep working on growing as a person both with her and when I am on my own. I have Piya to thank for all of this. ,It took me a couple of sessions to ease into therapy but I was am very satisfied with my experience. The activities she asked me to do were genuinely helpful and still helps me cope with my issues. As a patient, even I had to put in that effort so that I could reach a better place mentally. I was comfortable to open up about my problems and she could ask the right questions to help me out and it was dealt with in an objective way. I felt much calmer after my therapy sessions and helped me gain clarity in dealing with my issues independently. ",600,Ms. Piya Banerjee,5.0,Psychologist

Ghosh ENT Foundation Hospital,Kolkata,"MBBS, MS - ENT",20,"One fine morning I wake up with my left ear completely blocked and was not able to decide what to do as the sensation was so irritating. I was looking for any ENT in the first half of the day and found Dr. Tushar Kanti Ghosh via Practo. But upon calling the clinic I was told that same day appointment is not possible and i may have to wait for 4-5 days . The bad thing was I was already on my way to the doctor. Upon requesting and explaining my situation I was able to consult Dr. Ghosh and within 15 mins of reaching the clinic, Dr. Ghosh checked my ear and removed the wax which was causing the blockage. Really happy and satisfied and will refer Dr. Tushar Kanti Ghosh to all., i am very helpful thnx sir.  and i was recommended please visit this founbfdation then you have got it your positive result,On 1st September 2018 I went to doctor T.K. Ghosh with parotid gland swelling in Ghosh Ent Foundation. ,After USG and FNAC tests on 15th September 2018 he  concluded that it is Pleomorphic adenoma i.e. a benign tumor.So, there was no other option except surgery called ""Superficial Parotidectomy"" . On 20th September I was operated for approximately one and half hour. On the next day the discharge tube was removed and I was released from the hospital. On 28th September the bandages were removed and on 8th October the stitches were completely undone. I am fine now. The facial nerve was not affected . I didnot face any facial asymmetry too . These highlight that the operation was successful . He maintains a very cordial relationship with his patients and explains the health issue very clearly. Though the tumor was in the front side of the ear , there is hardly any scar mark infront, most of the stitches were behind the ear.That was the beauty of his divine work. Thank you so much doctor. You are no less than the  God to me.His team members , junior doctors and nurses were exceedingly caring and helpful.The administrator and receptionists were co-operative too. My overall experience was great. ,Doctor Tushar Kanti Ghosh is as good as God for me . Since I am suffering from Ear infection . And visited many doctors . I am glad to share my experience , since one of ""Pandit"" who usually visited my home during Navratri puja told my mom to take me to Dr Tushar Kanti Ghosh. Since the he  visited different house were one of the person is facing the same issue. I was facing this issue from last 2.5 years .But after second visit I am freely doing my work since last 1 year without any problem. There was a time when I am not able to pick up any pcall and I thought I had lost everything. The issue was so serious that I was on bed for 15 days and not able to move my neck due to such infection. Dr Ghosh pick me up wen I lost my hope totally. Since there are doctors but we are fortunate that he is in Kolkata. Apart from this he guided me very well and I do just according to what he and told me to do. At the age of 27 almost I have to take a belt on my neck . But after taking treatment from Dr Tushar Kanti Ghost I just left all those medicine and belts which are not working for me.

It did take time for me to get geared up and land up in her clinic one day, and since then its been the major turning point of my life. I have become focused towards my diet my exercises and I feel myself again. Though its been only a month showing her and I have lost 1.5 kilos in say 2 weeks time which i feel is awesome and that too without major change in my diet. Hats off to her for her lovely work and the support. I would recommend everyone facing weight gain problems to go to her, and especially recommend to those who where fit at one point of time and has lost hope in themselves to go for sure. JUST A CALL and JUST A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY. All the very best to her to achieve what she wants in life.,I am Anindya Ghosh, i was weighing 130 kgs and life for me was bad. I was getting into depression mode. But, thanks to Dr.Anubha, she is a very good listener and a very soft spoken lady. She has not only counseled me but has motivated me to follow each and every step towards reduction of weight. I cannot ask for more from God as i am currently weighing 94 kgs due to her guidance.

32 Pearls Dental  Clinic,Kolkata,BDS,12,"It was a great experience doctor was very friendly and the way he treated me very nice and good ID I am very thankful to doctor treated mevery well thanks a lot,In Mid of March 2019, I had a sudden tooth pain in right side near my upper molars when I woke up on one warm morning. I called one of my friend staying in dum dum who suggested me to visit Doctor Kaushik Ray (32 Pearl Dental Clinic) as his chamber was very close to my office and his treatment was recommended to be very accurate. I was in intense pain so I called Doctor Kaushik Ray immediately for an appointment and doctor sab was kind enough to give me his appointment, the very next day. I was in so much pain that I wanted to get rid of the tooth and get a bridge or implant done though it would have been a costlier treatment. On day of appointment, as soon as he saw my tooth, he immediately told me that one of my molars in the affected area had been drilled and filed earlier and the same tooth is causing problem, so he did an x-ray and it was discovered that the filing of that tooth had broken along with the tooth and it has resulted in an infection in the gumline. He suggested to get an RCT immediately otherwise I will lose the tooth. I told him to remove the tooth but he was sure that the tooth can be saved and he gave me assurance that he will cure my tooth as well as the intense pain, I just need to keep myself anxiety free and patience. Doctor sab is a very polite man with soft behaviour. It was like I was sitting Infront of my elder brother and discussing my problems. Therefore, I agreed to get the RCT done and the session was started in next appointment, I had lot of questions and uneasiness during my treatment, every time I asked him about them, he answered every question patiently and gave apt medicines to reduce my pain and discomfort during the treatment. After several sitting scattered during a period of 1 month I was finally pain free and my tooth felt better then ever. Thank you, Doctor Sab. You baught of me out of that dental agony.,I’m very happy for him treatment .I’m also refer to others he take care for me very well. ..........,Dr koushik Roy is very caring  helpful  well -behaved friendly and communicative.He is also a very soft spoken person.He nicely explained me the root canal treatment.i highly recommend to all my friends and family.Thank u sir for my painless root canal treatment.",200,Dr. Kaushik Roy,4.5,Dentist

I was asked to come for upper two premolars extraction on 20th Dec 2018 by Dr. Gargi. So I went on the said date to the clinic and while Dr.Gargi made sure that anaesthesia shots wouldn't hurt and tried to keep my mind off of the injection (which she successfully did cuz it indeed didn't hurt that much when she injected LA), but being the brave girl that I am, I still fainted and Doctor had to postpone the extraction on 6th Jan 2019. So I had my appointment yesterday and needless to say I was really scared. Seeing my anxiety and fear, Doctor suggested I get the LA shots done from Dr.Debjit. By this time I just wanted to get done with it. Went to Dr. Debjit's unit afterwards where I had to wait for a while and on informing that I am ready for the surgery I went inside and sat on that chair which I never dreaded until now. But this time, honestly I didn't feel a thing when Dr.Debjit was giving me the anaesthesia shots. Not even the feeling you get when something is pricked in your skin. I was actually not scared at all by this time or fainted. He is that good. He is amazing!! The extraction was done without any discomfort and now I am actually looking forward for my next extraction appointment. Post care instructions were also precisely informed by Dr.Debjit. And on my next visit, I'll tell Dr.Gargi to appoint me to Dr.Debjit for lower tooth extraction. :P Words are falling short right now. He is so so good and thank you so much Dr.Debjit!

I understand she is a busy person, but one of the qualities of a good doctor is that he / she is cooperative, which Dr. Mukherjee clearly lacks. There were some abrupt fluctuations in the blood sugar level of my mother and Dr. Mukherjee put her on high doses of insulin. When the sugar level fell down abruptly because of high doses of insulin, she advised my mom to have sugary intake. And trust me, this was the only solution she gave my mother when asked repititively on how to tackle sudden falls. I felt like she didn't even care to investigate much into the problem.

Then someone at The Rush gym suggested me to consult a dietician. I met Juhi Mimani, the dietician at that gym. When I met her, I was extremely sceptical about the impending diet and was nervous that I would have to sacrifice eating altogether. After meeting her though, I came to know many aspects about fitness and diet. They both go hand in hand and without following a disciplined food regime, it would be impossible to loose weight by working out alone. She was also flexible with my diet and gave me options. Soon I started losing kilos bit by bit. My trainer Gautam helped me immensely with my workout and in sync with the diet, the results started showing. Today I have lost 10 kgs in 3 months with systematic workouts & a disciplined diet. I am thankful to Juhi maam and Gautam Sir to have helped me in this journey.

I had started resorting to crash diets which left me listless and tired all the time. Consulting sucharita has changed my life..I realise it is actually possible to lose weight on a full stomach!! She has  changed my whole outlook towards diet and nutrition and I am forever grateful to her for making me a healthier and happier individual.  I am on the second phase of my diet now and I hope that the good results continue. Thank you sucharita for everything!! ,She has been a surprise in my struggle to lose weight. I consulted her as soon as I joined a work out regime. She was a wonderful listener n counselor, I must say. She suggested me a very easy to follow food habit (I prefer not to call this a diet 😁). She ensured that I don't starve. The best part of her session was that my plate always looks so better, vibrant and moreover fuller than anyone else in my family and colleagues. I never had a single thought of giving up. This was all about the initial phase. N surprisingly I lost 4 kg at the end of first phase (obviously with moderate exercise everyday). I always recommend her to everyone whosoever is struggling to find out the proper solution for weight loss. Sucharita Mam, u made a fitter version of me. A big thumbs up!👍👍👍👍,I met Ms.Sucharita Sengupta today at her office. She patiently listened to all the queries i asked, then she gave her recommendations on the same. In regards to her prescription, she gave me a whole array of items which I am comfortable with, keeping my present status and profession in mind. I would surely recommend her .,As my blood sugar level was considerably higher than normal, and since my physician was compelled to withdraw all medicines (including medicines which had been prescribed to address the problem of high blood sugar), I had asked Mrs.Sucharita Sengupta to prescribe a diet for me so that my blood sugar levels do not rise any further. I followed the diet prescribed by her for 2 weeks. Thereafter, when my blood sugar levels were checked I found that my blood sugar levels have come down significantly (& that too without any medication). In fact, the pp level is within normal range now. I have benefitted a lot by following her advice.",750,Ms. Sucharita Sengupta,5.0,Dietitian/nutritionist

I would never recommend anyone to visit him. I had visited to him at ILS Hospital Saltlake Kolkata for treatment of my 2 yrs old son suffering with high fever. While meeting with him in his chamber, my son got fibral convulsion and he immediately advised for admit. On the moment I agreed for admission. He prescribed some medicine and went away. Rather  than explaining any thing about the fibral convulsion that why it came, he humiliated us and attitude was not good. He prescribed some test. While taking the blood sample from son nurses not obtained the sample properly and blown some blood on the bed. Even not handled the sample properly and it got clot. Hence pathologist again wanted to take out the blood from my son. Seeing such thing I refused to admit. When I consulted the doctor he himself says dont come again to meet with me. This attitude was very bad.  When I came next day with the report he was not ready to see the blood test report. Even while calling for appointment & seeing the report he cut the call without answering.  Every time we have to pay 800 for his appointment even for seeing the report. Even no other doctor of the hospital ready to see the report. Hence I had very bad experience with DR Rajesh Goyal & ILS Hospital Salt Lake both while my first visit to the doctor & hospital.,Pros -,Dr Rajesh goel came late by 1 hout as scheduled and he went straight to nurses chamber n when he came out he started abusing us and said why you have cone. Also he told rudely after hearing fron nurses that we have been enquiring for his arrival. he asked whether we wabt him see baby or not which we flatly refused.

Because of my hectic schedule and work timings I was unable to maintain myself and gained lot of weight in 2 years. I even observed few health issues after that and it was then I came across dietitian Dipika who helped me with proper diet explaining the importance of healthy lifestyle and food habits. It's very important to have a healthy lifestyle along with little bit of physical exercise. I would highly recommend everyone who is suffering from the same problem.  ,I work in night shifts and hence was suffering from metabolism & nutrition disorder. Dr Singh-Naskar diagnosed my problems and explained why and hiw my job is effecting my health. She suggested appropriate diet and a few excercises to suit my lifestyle and following that i am in a lot better state now. I can feel the changes in myself and touchwood haven't faced the troubles since then. I am highly satisfied with her treatment and would recommend her to everybody.,It all started with my pregnancy, I continued gaining weight till I met my nutritionist, Dipika. Even in my busy schedule she helped me loose my weight with proper diet plan and guidance. Now I feel much lighter and energetic and thanks to Dipika ma'am to make this much impossible task possible in just a little effort!,She is exceptional..i was having multiple prob viz. Thyroid, uric acid, hypertension & high cholesterol...weight was gaining like anything....during consultation she made me understand my problem very nicely & fixed my diet chart very meticulously which helped a lot to reduce some extra pounds within 3 weeks only...her process of diagnose & treatment definitely carries weightages....i strongly recommend her name ",700,Ms. Dipika Singh,5.0,Dietitian/nutritionist

Mansi Therapy,Kolkata,"M.Phil - Clinical Psychology, MSc - Applied Psychology",6,"After suffering from depression and anxiety for more than a decade I decided to give therapy a shot and I was referred to therapist Ms. Anwesha Bhattacharyya. Given that I am an introvert, I always had reservations about sharing my deepest insecurities with anyone. But with her, it was never an issue. Her calm, affable demeanour put me at ease and I was able to confide to her what was bothering me without the fear of being judged. She listened to everything very patiently and focused on understanding them first before suggesting ways to deal with them. She offered clarity on many issues when I was confused and unable to figure it out myself. Such was her depth of understanding! She infused me with hope and positivity from the very first session itself and with every passing session thereafter I began to find part of my lost self back. My interest in things I care about came back and I started pursuing my goal with renewed vigour. The sense of exhilaration cannot be put in words. My experience with her has been entirely positive and refreshing. If I feel alive today it is because of her.,I have suffered from depression,anxiety and other psychological problems long enough to hinder my career goals. I decided to visit Anwesha when I knew I could not go on with life. Her pleasant demeanor , calm presence and easy yet effective explanation of my problems made me sort out my thoughts in a different perspective. ,I never thought that our thought process and mental cleaning needs attention. Initially I was iffy to go to a therapist did not have any idea that it can work magic. But certainly magic can only possible if the doctor understands your problem. I was jaw dropped to decipher how Dr Anwesha connected all the dots between me, my mother and my sister. Now I m a firm believer that every individual needs a mental sorting and doctor like her is helping us to do the process. I m grateful to Dr Anwesha that she took time from my mother’s session to discuss with me and my sister our own issue. So I ended up that I too need mental sorting to lead a healthy life. The personal attention Dr Anwesha gives in listening and understanding is wat a patient requires. I would recommend her sessions to as many people as I can ppl like us needs doctors like her. Thank you very much for making our life better and better. ,I am a 21 year old woman and I was suffering from depression and many other insecurities. I turned to therapy from Dr. Anwesha and I have not only recovered from depression but also I have gained self confidence. Being an introvert it was difficult for me to touch my deepest insecurities and the biggest fears. However, Anwesha ma'am helped me out of it. Taking therapy from her has been the best decision until now. I definitely recommend her for all those who need help psychologically and emotionally  ",1000,Ms. Anwesha Bhattacharyya,5.0,Psychologist

Medipoint Clinic,Kolkata,"Masters in Clinical Psychology, BA - Psychology",9,"She is very sincere and dedicated to her work. Will make you feel like a friend almost immediately and you can trust her. She keeps her work confidential and is a very good psychologist, who not only helps you out of your situation but also helps your family. Would recommend her 100% to everyone. ,I can't recommend her enough. She inspires, motivates, pushes me to believe in myself, and what not. I started treatment for OCD, Major depressive disorder, Problems due to Dependent personality, and other psychological issues in Delhi when she was working there. I have come so far, have progressed so much in terms of mental health and the quality of life. I was terribly depressed and I didn't have a value based lifestyle which was one of the roots to my disorders. I have always been creative and before taking treatment by her I had interests I wanted to pursue BUT now I have hobbies, before the treatment, I was always suicidal and with the advance in treatment the suicidal state started to disappear slowly and now I haven't felt that way since two years. I was able to overcome gutka addiction of 13 years, with her help.,Initially I was in dilemma whether I need counseling or not but finally I choose to give myself a chance and select Ms. Poulomi Bhattacharjee. She is a great person as well as a great therapist. I visited her with Severe disorders, she listens carefully and try to understand the root of the problem and suggest me few things to do as daily chores that help me to recover pretty well with in a month. She just simply change the way I was looking to myself and  she believes in me more than I do.,It was a great experience. I really appreciate her work. She made my girlfriend a better person today. I owe her now. I think she is the one I and my girlfriend were looking for.",600,Ms. Poulomi Bhattacharjee,,Psychologist

She is recovering and able to walk noe.,honestly he is the best dr. for piles treatment in kolkata. one of my collegue was facing the problem of fissure. I went to dr. purnendu along with my collegue.. after he diagnosed him he explained everything about the causes & treatment of the disease. it was a seamless experience for him.,I visited the Doctor for gall bladder stone operation.

Dental World Super-Speciality Centre,Kolkata,MDS - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery,7,"I had read several reviews about a Wisdom Tooth Extraction and they had kind of given me a very negative vibe until Dr. Butta started working on 2 of my left Wisdom teeth. He knew I was worried about the implications, so he described each and every procedure that he would conduct on my teeth as and how they went. He applied a numbing spray and then a local anesthesia (very honest confession - a very minor prick and pressure felt). While applying he kept making me aware as to when the pressure might be felt; nothing came as a surprise - No Pain till now! Then he gave me 25 mins approx so that the area became completely numb. The process started after 25 odd minutes and he used an apparatus to check whether I could feel anything - explained everything before doing. The area was totally numb - he started and to tell you honestly, it took him about 25-30 mins to extract both the Wisdom teeth and I didnt even understand when they came out (not 0.1% pain or pressure felt); I had kept my eyes shut throughout. Towards the end he said there would be a little pressure and I did feel that (not any pain). He stitched the area and I could feel that as the 'threads' were rubbing against my lips! Bingo - done. No pain absolutely. No pain at all - he showed me both my teeth. Then he gave me certain routines to follow and that was it. Value for money and patients treated pretty well; very friendly and polite doctor. Thanks Dr. Butta - thanks a lot. ,Dr. Utsav Butta is an excellent Dentist and a great doctor. I was very hesitant to visit a dentist as many had scared me about the painful procedures. However Dr. Butta & his team explained the details & procedures I would need very well, which gave me confidence that I was in good hands. Furthermore, Dr. Utsav did not rush with completing and of the treatments as he knew I was very conscious of the pain & therefore he took time to complete the root canal & extraction, thereby ensuring I had good time to heal & manage the surgeries. Due to this I had no pain through any of the treatments needed. I am glad I chose to visit Dr UTSAV BUTTA for all my dental needs. ,Excellent experience. Dr. Butta explained every detail of the treatment clearly and reassuringly before and during the operation. The support staff and other Doctors were very polite and helpful. I FELT NO PAIN throughout the entire procedure and recovery period afterwards.,My experience with Dr, Utsav Butta has been a pleaant one. He sincerely listened to my problems, patiently diagnosed and explained the matter to us before surgery. Finally, he operated on me with utmost care and has taken great pain in following post operative consultations.",800,Dr. Utsav Butta,5.0,Dentist

But this is not so true. ,I thought weight loss is a myth, till I met Dr. Nafisa. I had tried many diet plans and many suggestions for almost 4 years but none of them worked. Then i thought of giving  a try with professional Dietitian and found First eat right rated well in many online reviews. I met the doctor and opted for 3 month support plan for 17k, which they have mentioned in their website too. ,Dr.Nafeesa's diet was very helpful. I lost close to 15 Kgs over a period of 5 months. I had a lot of doubts in mind when i started. It took me a week to get adjusted to my new diet pattern but i followed it as per the suggession along with the workouts. The best part of it was that all that was prescribed was from what i could make at home on a regular basis based on our cuisine and culture & i think thats what made it sustainable as i didn't have to make anything different for myself. I come from a vegetarian south Indian family which has lots of festivals & sweets as part of the custom but i was guided on how to be able to balance it not having to give up completely too. I only wished the doctor was available over WhatsApp too but however she would patiently respond to our queries over mail within a few days. She has a team of nutritionists who would be available over WhatsApp for any day to day queries during working hours. Overall, helped me understand my body, it's nutritional requirement & how to manage it. I hope i'll be able to maintain this in the coming years too. ,It was always about feeling healthy, energetic and be within normal BMI range. My first meeting with Dr. Nafeesa convinced me very well on her approach to meet my lifestyle as well as continue to remain fit after the course ends.
