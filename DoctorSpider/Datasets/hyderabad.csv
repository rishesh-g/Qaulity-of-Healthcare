"Apollo Sugar Clinic,Humain Health",Hyderabad,MD - Physician,15,"Myself R.Gireesh, I have booked an appointment with Dr.Jayaprakashsai after i googled about him in internet.Some of his statements from the website (deardiabetes.in)impressed me very much and which made me to meet him are 1.""Passion in empowering public on Diabetes Education and Prevention"" 2.""Believes in Holistic Approach in Managing Diabetes"" . When i first met him my sugar levels are high, my HbA1c is high ""9.5"" and also Liver function test parameters (SGOT,SGPT)are also high.Doctor immediately didn't gave high medication.He did very good counseling to change my lifestyle.Doctor listens to the patient coolly and the way he interacts with patient will be like talking to a friend or well wisher.Doctor gave confidence and motivation which inspired me to follow the diabetic lifestyle, which helped me to decrease the sugar levels with basic medication.Because of the decrease in sugar levels, my liver function test parameters also decreased.I'm  happy for not only decreased sugar levels but I'm double happy for my decreased liver function test parameters.In the Current commercial era  it is very hard and difficult to get a such good doctor because medication any doctor can write but giving confidence,motivation and inspiring the patient is divine quality.With such a high profile very down to earth person.I feel ""Dr.Jayaprakashsai"" meaning of a doctor.   , came across as a friend encouraged me to beat diabetes with a change in life style food habits and exercise. I just followed his prescription and her I am one month later with my diabetes in control and with a new out look on life. , a doctor like him diabetes will be defeated.  I'm gonna recommend this clinic alone to all in my contact to Dr Sai. I wish docs with such dedication were available everywhere so that disease would be in control and a country like India will be diabetes free. Thank you Dr Sai and thee excellent team of Radhika, Ashwini and Anupama and Dr Zubeida, He listens to the patients and treats patients like family members.he understands patient very well and he is not like other doctors.when I came to him I was so tensd. He counselled me very well and now  I am perfectly fit.he does not use any medicine and controlls diabetic with counselling and  simple life style changes.in simple he gave me life.if ur prone to diabetic I strongly recommend to go for him.,It is an amazing experience to meet Dr. Sai. My mother was diagnosed with adult diabetes a decade back and it was not a good experience for her. She was often juggled between opinions, medicines, doctors. Somewhere she started developing stress and started neglecting health to an extent of stopping all prescribed medicines and diet. After convincing her to try the new Apollo diabetic clinic we walked in without knowing whom to see. Boy was it a pleasant surprise to meet Dr. Sai and dietician Radhika :-) ",550,Dr. J.Jayaprakashsai,,General Physician

On  examining the MRI report and films, he diagnoised it as Lumbar disc bulge between L3/4, L4/5(severe) and L5/S1 and it needs surgery, recommended Micro disectamy. We were shocked on hearing this. The Dr said no option and it's simple and can become normal with in 10 days after surgery. We took second opinion from another famous neurosurgeon. He also told the same thing. By this time she is not able to walk properly, not able to sit, bend and became dependent on others and not able to sleep at nights because of continuous pain.,I came to this doctor when the other doctors were not able to diagnose my problem itself correctly. I struggled for 3years with blood in my motions, pain n cannot eat properly, mentally upset with my problem.  The other doctors operated me saying fissure, then I had repeated colonoscopy tests and MRI tests, but no relief and I was using so many tablets daily. I was treated by doctors in India and Germany also. They said I have to be on tablets lifelong and it may be Chrons. Then I approached Dr.Sarangapani Garu whom I know from before, as he treated my relatives also. He first listened to my problem and asked me why did I undergo so many tests and why I am using so many medicines which are not really required. He then gave me a positive thought about life because by that time I was really in a state of confusion going through so many tests, consulting so many doctors. Then he gave me medicines for 2months, after using those I felt so much relieved from my problem and mentally free from the disease.

This was great experience. i would highly recommend her,Before Dr.Sneha I did not have many good experiences with Dentists, but she is a true exception. She was kind and explained the issue and provided the prognosis in detail. The treatment was done by Dr Preeti, she was quick and gentle during the procedure and I'm out of the clinic in 1 hour.

When i told my mobile number for registration verification,  he checked and didn't tell me that it is not there and kept silent. Then after couple of minutes i asked to him that what happened then he says that its not there. What was he waiting for? Then i asked check with my husband's number , he entered 5 times and said that number is not there in the system. I said i got registered a week before only. Then he suddenly said that it does exist. I dont know what was his intention to create all that story. Secondly,  i was second in queue and someone came behind and he entertained the other person before me and gave receipt to him. There is no queue etiquettes. Plus how come that Abhilash is supposed to take person who is not in queue. When i tried to complain the same to the 2 ladies on second floor outside doctor Sai kranthi's cabin, they said there is no complaint system here and they dont know anything. How come that such a big hospital doesn't have any complaint system. This wasted my so much time on cash counter itself. No proper training to the staff of this hospital it seems., I have been getting treatment from him for scalp acne from past 5 months, and the results are pretty good. He makes sure that every patient can afford those medicines. That's the best part of his kindness.I have seen him calling to medical store and enquiring about the price of a medicine in order to make sure that he is recommending best medicine at affordable price. I recommend him.,I went for corn treatment. The corn was removed and it came back.,I used a medicine previously and that worked better than the one he suggested. Finally my corn problem (which was there for more than 2 months) was cured through simple home remedies as suggested in a blog (a blog written by a allopathy doctor) I found in internet.

Since it was Sunday(afternoon) and most of the ENT clinic were closed, we visited HITECH Eye and ENT care, Manikonda where Dr Ashok is a visiting consultant. The people at HITECH immediately contacted Dr Ashok who immediately responded and he had to travel from Banjara Hills to Manikonda ( ~10 kms) for this emergency. That shows the Doctors commitment towards unknown patients on a Holiday forget about known patients. We had to wait since Dr Ashok had to travel around 10 kms but it was worth waiting because as soon as Dr Ashok arrived he attended the kid immediately and within 2 minutes the balloon part was removed and we were all relieved. I would highly rate Dr Ashok for his commitment and professionalism . May God bless him with Good Health .,I got a ear piercing done but due to series of unfortunate decisions I took to experiment with my new piercing I got a ear piercing infection. I went to doc and he explained to me very nicely why I got the infection . Even he responded very nicely to me in Watsapp. Then again met him at continental hospital for a minor surgery kind of thing. Just normal like taking out the pus and cleaning the area and providing a sterile object in the piercing to prevent it from closing . He Gave me an ointment which worked like wonders on my wound. My ear is fine now within 2 weeks of the visit. I would definitely recommend him. Thanks a lot doc.,I am having ear infection and was initially getting treatment from different doctor at Citizen Hospital. But I was not seeing any significant improvement. So I took the appointment based on the feedback I got from my colleague who used to visit to Dr Ashok at his clinic. But after my first visit today at Himagiri Hospital Gachibowli, I am satisfied with the doctor's suggestion. He explained the issue and why this happened and the treatment. I am still under treatment now and follow up visits are planned in couple of days to remove the dressing. So overall I would recommend worth visiting to Dr Ashok.,His calm demeanour coupled with his patience and experience really helped him identify not just the problem but also the root cause. I have certain dietary allergies and they cause several ENT issues if not kept in check( as I learnt). He was clearly able to identify this before I could even explain. The medication he gave helped relieve my allergy and symptoms soon and his thorough investigation helped him identity the cause and now I am on course to further prevent such issues by taking care of my diet. Others just rubbished it as a cold and cough whereas he really got down to the root and helped despite symptoms being similar. I wholeheartedly recommend him as many people lately are suffering from a wide range of ENT issues though the symptoms might be normal, many might be suffering from allergies even they didn't know they have.

I go there for yearly check up. While the doctor is professional and friendly. I found myself waiting for 60-90 minutes every now and then. For my last visiting on 26th Nov, 2019 for which I took an appointment for 12 noon, more than a month ago. I was waiting for 90 minutes, the staff there does not have value for customers time. Staff, try use delay tactics like 5 minute more and repeat the same.  I have not so good experience when it comes to maintaining appointments commitments. ,I have been loosing teeth periodically from my young age and I was left out with only 4 teeth when I attained the age of 61 years. For the last 2 years I have been using removable dentures. I faced extreme inconvenience with removable dentures in these two years. Though I have an idea of going for permanent implants, I have not ventured for it after hearing their stories from my friends who suffered a lot by going through traditional procedures in implants, which involves painful procedures and long duration treatment. At this juncture, my friend from Melbourne, Australia who was in India in November, 2017 in connection with his daughter's marriage has undergone full mouth implants surgery with Dr. Irfan Motiwala. He told me that though he was busy in performing his daughter's marriage, his surgery has not disturbed his programmes, since it was simple and completed within a week. But, still I waited for one more year to find his situation after one year. He informed me that even after one year he has no problems with the implants and able to eat all types of food. Then, I took appointment of Dr. Irfan Motiwala for 30th March, 2019. He took X-ray and scanning on that day and told me that though upper jaw is little thin, we can go ahead with full mouth implants. He started my surgery on 1st April, 2019. It was my pleasant surprise that extraction of 4 teeth and fixing the base implants was completed on the first day itself. Temporary denture was given to me. In the next sitting dentures were ready and the doctor checked them fora trial. After making some modifications to the dentures, they were fixed on 8th April, 2019. I felt slight pain only for the first two days.The entire procedure was done in jet speed with accuracy. I left the clinic with total confidence and convenience. During the course of treatment, I found Ultimate Professionalism. in the doctor. Further, the doctors assisting him are well trained and they have very sofisticated tools and equipment in the clinic.

He is a plastic/cosmetic surgeon, we should have consulted Dr Keerthan (Dr Dushyant's wife) but in her absence, he attended us and left and super impression.,Doctor always begins by asking me what look I am looking for and then proceeds to give me his opinions. What I want is always valued by doctor and he never tries to impose his ideas if I do not want it. Moreover doctors recommendations are always very practical and the option that best suits my face. He never overdoes any procedure and believes less is better when it comes to lip fillers as we can always top up later once I get a proper idea of what my lips look like after swelling has subsided. I really value this because I have seen many botched lips on other women who overfill. While I only use fillers in my lips doctor follows the same method for fillers in any other area. He also always explains to me what substances he is using for me and how it works in order to make me feel comfortable. If he ever uses a different kind of filler when I come in for a top up he carefully tells me about how it differs from the previous filler. I also feel that the procedures are priced very appropriately. ",500,Dr. Dushyanth Kalva,5.0,Plastic Surgeon

Satisfied with the treatment.Way of asking questions is unique.Doctor is so interactive.,Doctor is well experienced , and provided valuable suggestions to the patient.,doctor is not available and I have waited for so long then consulted an other doctor. Not satisfied ,We booked appointment online for 11am but Dr Kasturi came at 12:00 noon. After assessment of my aunt she ordered for an ultrasound scan of abdomen and also wrote some basic blood investigations in her own hospital which we agreed for diagnosing the health condition. After the scan, one of her staff came to withdraw blood sample from my aunt who pricked nearly five times and was unable to take the blood. My aunt was in pain and I asked them if I could take the sample as I also belong to medical profession. They asked me to take 8mls of blood and I took it for the first prick. After which we went to the registration counter to find out around what time we can get the blood sample results which is when the staff again came to us saying they need some more blood for some other irrelevant investigations for which we disagreed. Those blood investigations are irrelevant to my aunt's condition and we just went for out patient consultation. Dr Kasturi who is business minded and money minded tried to steal money for irrelevant investigation which would have costed around 5000rs/- extra. As I belong to the same profession and know the importance of those irrelevant investigations I advise clients who go to her ask her the reason behind every test she orders. Apart from that she lost her patience and shouted at my family in the reception infront of everyone saying that she won't review my aunt's scan report until and unless we get all of the irrelevant blood investigations done orels leave the place. When I asked the reason why is that those irrelevant tests are so important she didn't reply to it and told me off saying that I can take my aunt home and do my own treatment. Please everyone be careful with these kind of doctors whom you go to thinking that they are most senior doctors. I was not worried about the money but how can you believe such money minded doctors could treat us of our sickness as they are sick themselves. If it was an illiterate person she would have  made  the bill for some ten thousand rupees just for investigations. Immediately I consulted three more gynaecologists who suggested that those blood tests are unnecessary until a patient is admitted in the hospital for a long time or for some surgery which we didn't go for at all. If the doctor speaks to you nicely and gives you enough time it doesn't mean they are excellent you need to understand that these are all the tricks they use to make the patient feel great and steal money from them.

Your treatment really helped me curing thyroid imbalances. You have understood my problem quickly though I was repeating the same again and again. I really liked the way you explained in your laptop about the Thyroid problems and hormone imbalances with the scientific images in a layman terms. Thank you very much for your kind attention and treatment. I strongly recommend the doctor for all hormones imbalances.,I have been seeing this dr. for 3 years for my mother's Thyroid and Diabetes issue. He is an excellent person with great concern for patients. He takes care to explain the patient's medical problem and why a specific medication is needed and the way medicines would function like for Thyroid or metformin plain vs SR use. I would strongly recommend people to see him for Thyroid or Sugar related issues than seeing a general physician or cardiologist. A few people have written negative comments but I can say with own personal experience that with his exclusive clinic, he has only gone from being good to better.  People need to be a bit more practical on waiting time as there are a lot of patients waiting to see him. Book on Practo and be on time, it will be done in 30-45 min. Definitely need more doctors like him.,Dr Nagesh is an excellent clinician - endocrinologist and is in my opinion on par with some of the best specialists I had consulted and received treatment from in The States where I spent the majority of my 54 years.  My mother and father are both physicians - and I thereby have met informally and formally  many of their medical doctor colleagues since childhood -  so I can discern a good physician  based on preconditioned intuition.,I have been consulting Dr.Nagesh from last 3 months, ever since the onset of diabetes on me. I can say that his way of treatment is stupendous. He understands the issue well and demonstrates good knowledge about the illness. He is also very prompt in reverting back via emails for any queries by patients. With his guidance, I am able to well manage my diabetes, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Dr.Nagesh for anyone who wants to manage their diabetes effectively.",600,Dr. Sri Nagesh,,Endocrinologist

The follow-up from his side was really excellent, cannot be explained in words, as he was always available in calls whenever needed. I am still under his care as I am getting treated for dental implants at his clinic, Yatha dental care. He gives you a complete picture of treatment so that we can just sit and relax by completely trusting him with the top class facility and expertise that he has at the clinic.

I visited almost all the famous hospitals and got him treated with medications. Recently, I took my dad to Sunshine hospital expecting a similar treatment for knee pains. It was not my idea to get him operated for knee replacement until I met Dr. Suhas Masilamani who thoroughly examined my dad and discussed the necessity of Knee replacement. He is very patient to listen to our problems (spends nearly 30 mins - Incredible) and ensures they are addressed appropriately. He initiated the surgery process and within no time, my father got operated and is able to walk on his own. I would like to Thanks Dr. Suhas Masilamani for providing such a care to my father. Very much appreciated! I pray God to bless him and exalt him in all his work.,My mother had undergone a minor elbow surgery.,My wife was totally desperate and not able to walk few steps about 10 months back.

"Apollo Hospitals,Apollo DRDO Hospital,Apollo Cradle",Hyderabad,"MBBS, MS - General Surgery, MCh - Pediatric  Surgery",22,"As Dr Nagendra was busy with surgery, I left a message on whatsapp to him. He was kind enough to call me back and as I had already sent the child's report through mail, he had a total clarity with his present state. Next day (Thursday) met him at Apollo Jubilee Hills and decided to go ahead with Surgery for inguinal testes and planned it for Saturday.  I was deeply moved when he helped me with all the admission and financial related formalities and explained in detail what exactly will be the surgical process in a lucid and clear manner. He is simply mesmerizing. There were nearly 15-20 patients needing surgeries on the D day. There were about 5-6 children shouting and crying to their peaks prior to entering the OT Complex. My 3yrs old son was also getting scared with all the noise and cries. Dr Yoga Nagendra to my surprise brought a Mobile Game just before his Surgery and gave it to the Child. My Son happily started playing and volunteered to go inside the OT on his own without a sign of any discomfort. I must admit that he was holding his Mobile Game firmly and was just not bothered of whatsoever distractions/noises. It was a great sigh of relief to see my son after 30mins of surgery. Dr came and explained what is his condition and the next action. My Son was still under the anesthesia effect. I frankly share that after talking to Dr Yoga Nagendra there was never a single moment when I was tense, afraid, confused or did any negative thoughts occur to me during the entire course of medical treatment of my son which was nearly spread for past one week prior to the surgery. But I got the biggest shock of my life once my son woke up and came out of the anesthesia effect. I thought my son would cry with pain, will be totally uncomfortable with all medicines and surgical interventions but the first thing what he was asking to me was ""Where is my Game papa"". Give me my Game"". Oh God ! I never expected that. Somehow Dr made my son very comfortable during all his interactions and he even remembers Kung Fu Panda pictures which he had shown during his first meeting. Dr Yoga Nagender is one of the best and fine gentleman. He was so busy with other surgeries that he immediately had to switch over to them after making us comfortable. Met him again in the evening and I must say I have rarely seen such a down to earth and nice person. I dont remember if I have thanked him. Thank you very much Doctor. Regards.

Pristyn Care,Hyderabad,"MBBS, DNB - General Surgery",11,"I had been suffering from a hernia in the area of my belly button. The pain was unimaginable and after 2 months of suffering from hernia. I decided to have surgery from a nearby hospital of Pristyn Care.The surgery was scheduled for the very next day at 1 p.m. They said that they'll send a cab to pick me up at the time of surgery. Unfortunately, the cab was late by an hour and the surgery started at 3 p.m. The surgery was quick and not as painful as I thought. After the surgery, the doctor advised me not to do any physical exertion for a month. I followed his advice and now I'm all good. Thanks to Pristyncare.  ,My mother had been suffering from chronic constipation for some time. She had developed third Grade Piles and because of this whenever she tried to pass the stool, she felt a lump. I now knew this could only be cured with laser treatment. So, I contacted Pristyn Care. The clinic was clean and very hygienic. The room at the hospital in which my mother stayed overnight was also clean. Only I have to takecare of the paperwork that actually consumed some time rest all was good. It was a different experience as I never imagined health services can be availed online without facing any hassle. Things are well planned at Pristyn Care associated clinics and hospitals. I recommend it without any doubt.  ,my mom  suffered with varicose veins of legs a lot & met many docs , Dr.Prudhvi explained  us well about  disease & took good care of my mom through out surgery & post-op ...me & my mom are  very happy . thanks to doc 😊,I was diagnosed with gallstones 2 months ago and was searching for the best treatment to get rid of it. I found out about Dr. K. Prudhvinath on Google. He worked at a Pristyn associated hospital. I felt a bit better after consulting him as he comforted me about the entire treatment. I really faced no difficulty in the treatment and the hospital was very hygienic. My private room had an in-room kit and the washroom was attached to the room only.

Pause for Perspective,Hyderabad,"M.Sc Counselling Psychology, BA - Psychology",2,"I consulted Rafath because I wasn't feeling very good in life and was clueless about how to move forward inspite of the issues I have. This was my first serious and successful attempt towards taking up therapy and I was pretty much skeptical about whom to consult. In my first session itself I was extremely satisfied with my choice. Rafath is a very kind, patient and a friendly doctor. She is a great listener and an even better explainer. Sometimes, I cannot fully understand how I feel and what I feel and most importantly why I feel the way I feel. This also makes difficult for me to put my feelings into words. But when I disclosed about my issues to her, she helped me in exactly explaining what I feel and why I feel. The best thing about her is when you are unsure about how to put your feelings into words and tell your story in bits and pieces, she reiterates that story in such a way that you understand what exactly is the problem and the reason behind your feelings. She made a lot of revelations about myself and helped me in discovering a lot of flaws in my perception. Had it not been for her, it would have been very difficult for me to look at things with a different perspective than usual. Before consulting her, I used to have very less amount of positive perception in life. But now, even if disappointments come my way, she helped me in looking further and analyzing the instances that led to the disappointment. She helped me and explained me about how to use those instances as a constructive feedback to avoid such disappointments in future. I had a lot of issues with self-confidence. I still do. But after consulting her, I can say for sure that my self confidence has definitely improved. Although the improvement is still in it's nascent stages and I still have a long way to go, I'm glad about the fact that I'm atleast making progress. So to sum it up, after consulting Rafath, I'm more positive than before. I'm more confident than before. I'm more equipped in looking at things from a different perception than before. I have improved in communicating about my issues in a better way. If you're somebody who, like me, is unsure about whom to consult, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND her to you. , better human being who sympathizes with you and makes sure you feel better after every session.,This was my first time at therapy. I was initially very sceptical about the idea itself. However, Ms Syeda Rafath's friendly and welcoming attitude changed my mind, on day one itself and motivated me to go ahead with follow up appointments. I feel very comfortable about sharing my thoughts and feelings with her, just as they exist. I've noticed her put the effort in verifying whether she reads me correctly or not, before drawing even the tiniest of conclusions. This gives me the feeling of a judgement-free environment and a reassurance that I will not be misunderstood. I believe that, this is an essential part of therapy. I have never felt dissatisfied with her and I don't see any reason why one must not seek her help. ,This is the first time I've attended a therapy session and indeed it was a good decision. Dr. Rafath made me feel comfortable and let me express myself with ease and listened to me patiently. Looking forward to more sessions and progress. ,Rafath is a kind and empathetic person who I have come to trust to be an active facilitator in my process of healing.",800,Ms. Syeda Rafath Unnisa,5.0,Psychologist

She very nicely explained us the crooked tooth problem of my daughter, showed us pictures to help us understand in details. She was very honest in her advice and in detail explained us the treatment plan.

The total treatment plan was for 1.5 years, Dr Anupriya always accommodated our preference for appointment time, all appointments started around the scheduled time. She constantly educated us on the progress on treatment and dos and don’t . Today the treatment ended and I am so happy that my daughter’s teeth are so nicely shaped and now look perfect. I feel my daughter feel more confident now. ,I was referred to Dr. Anupriya by a friend thus booked an appointment at the Banjara Hills clinic. I reached 10 min before appointment time; the girl at the reception registered me and asked me to wait for few min.

Dr Anupriya greeted me with a smile and patiently listened to my complaints.  She took notes, asked me habit related questions and the consultation went on. The treatment plan for properly explained to me, all my questions were duly addressed (and there were many as I had done my own internet search before doing to doctor). I felt comfortable and agreed for the treatment. Another wow for me when all sterile equipments brought and the packing was open in front of me.

After a year or so unfortunately one day i came to know that one of my colleague has taken transplantation from Hair sure as he said later, as a process of talking with him i decided to go later a week. I met Sreedhar sir and team they are very good to let me know the entire process and how cost it is and how much area it covers and all the things more over they charge reasonable price, they won't pressure you for surgery and even they don't make calls they leave us for our decission. after a month i went for surgery, i was so tensed for the future, if it is not work out what will be the solution like wise i tensed almost one and half month even after the surgery. now i was really very very happy it gives me a boost like anything.

I had heard about Prabhat sir from a colleague of mine and visited. The doc had recommended to get a couple of tests done part which he had recommended me to get a meniscus surgery done for a permanent fix. The doc never hurried and tried to give me more time, explained the crux of the issue and even sent me a few videos for me to understand and mentally prepare myself. He was extremely professional during surgery right from his patience in explaining the issue in detail both to family and me before surgery n after surgery to his care for his patients makes him stand out. While it was supposed to be a meniscus surgery once he started the scopy and realized that my ACL was damaged as well, explained the issue to my family showed photos and took their consent to fix that as well since it was the root cause of the meniscus injury n a better permanent fix. I really liked his honesty here as he could have simple gone ahead with meniscus repair as planned but his genuine intent of fixing the knee for good and suggesting whats the right thing to do for patients is appreciable. The time he gives to patients even during appointments is noteworthy. If you are looking for an ortho look no further. He has a really good support team as well Venkat who manages appointments n paperwork, Krishna one of the physio under him are very professional and good at what they do.

Hi everyone here is my story, for me the hair started falling from the age of 24, now i am 31, in the 7 years of time i lost almost the frontal area and bit more at the crown area too. Initially i am not interested to take transplantation because it's not good as our natural hair and i easily identified those guys who took hair transplantation as a result i was not think about of it, i consulted Batra's and Madhu's by friend's but i am not convinced of their treatment and i kept my thoughts aside. After a year or so unfortunately one day i came to know that one of my colleague has taken transplantation from Hair sure as he said later, as a process of talking with him i decided to go later a week. I met Sreedhar sir and team they are very good to let me know the entire process and how cost it is and how much area it covers and all the things more over they charge reasonable price, they won't pressure you for surgery and even they don't make calls they leave us for our decission. after a month i went for surgery, i was so tensed for the future, if it is not work out what will be the solution like wise i tensed almost one and half month even after the surgery. now i was really very very happy it gives me a boost like anything. Now it was my 119 th day. so many of my friends surprised of the results and the new babies (hairs) are very good in condition as like my natural hair.

Undergone PTCA with stenting for the blocks in different occasions during 2000 and 2006, when Dr C Raghu was the Director of Cardiology Dept at Yesodha Hospitals.  During 2013 CAG was performed and revealed that the above stents implanted long back i.e., more than 15 years are found to be in good intact condition and thus Dr. Raghu instigated a sort of self-cnfidence which made me to drive away my cardiac fear and thus prompted me to forget that I am a Cardiac patient.  Ofcourse, I used to contact him occasionally for periodic check ups and I am so fascinated at the friendly affection shown towards me.  I, therefore believe that the role of a Doctor should not only confine towards super speciality treatment but building confidence is more important to survive longer.

Though the physiological response was slow possibly due to my mothers immunological condition, as a Cardiologist he is good to examine the patient and interact with them well and prescribe suitably, but doesn't explain prescription clearly like whether any of the prev. medications are to be continued or not. Though support staff at Aster Prime were okay, appointments with this doctor go haywire by several hours due to poor scheduling as Doctors time distribution between his procedures/inpatients and OP is totally unpredictable and erratic, and timely information by the hospital to patients for rescheduling was lacking.

Doctor is Suresh Reddy. First question he asked after attending the patient is if he insured or not and second question is what does he do and what do I do. Initially they said it is dengue fever. But the blood platelets are consistent for 3 days in hospital. When i asked the doctor same question he said platelets will be standard for first 3 days of fever. I admitted my father on 2nd day of fever. When i asked the doctor in 4th day that it's been already 4 days and platelets are consistent, can it still be a dengue. He has no answer. , We are from Andhra and doctor never spent more than a minute in 3 days of hospitalisation. Never asked the patients problems, touched him or used his stethoscope. I always have to run behind him to clear my questions n doubts.,I had an extremely poor encounter with this doctor.,  I had to get the LFT report done, which is related to the liver. In the report the indirect bilirubin values were inconsistent with the direct bilirubin and total bilirubin values. I didn't know about the typo, and the doctor didn't even care to inform that to me. Infact he asked me to get admitted in to the hospital for 2 days. It was only later that I went to another hospital as my friends advised me to, , I had to go to this hospital in the first place because it was closest to my college IIIT Hyderabad and it was an emergency. When I went to another doctor he told me that the report might have a typo and asked me to get the LFT done once again for verification. So even he was not sure if it was a typo or not. And after I got the LFT done once again, it was clear that it was a typo from the person who created the report at Himagiri hospital. So I went back to Dr. Suresh reddy and to quote him he said - ""You could yourself had figured out it was a typo, because Total minus direct bilirubin is only indirect bilirubin"". I mean even after not pointing it out in the first place, and asking me get admitted to the hospital for 2 days, he still had the audacity to defend the typo and consider me responsible for not knowing about the typo myself, when I didn't even know about bilirubin. How did he even expect me to know all that. And when I told him, how do I know if there's equal weight of direct and indirect in total bilirubin, and I had to just do a sum of direct and indirect bilirubin to get the total, he not only did not entertain the argument, rather he accused me of having bad intentions of getting the money. I was disappointed and when I told him that I will complain against him he said he doesn't care because he was not responsible for the typo, when infact the whole argument for not even about the typo. It was about he not informing me about that and later defending it by expecting me to know about it. I would recommend to not choose this doctor at all.

The fact that she has enormous experience in her field has been proven in every way. I’d like to highlight that despite my mother being Deaf and Dumb, Dr Padmini communicated so well with my mom which was another surprising factor. We are so thankful for her generosity, modest nature and her absolute frankness. This little acquaintance my mother had with the doctor is worth remembering. It was a real pleasure to see and meet such doctors who counsel patients with such perseverance and prospective approach really made an impact on us. Also the manner of counselling which we received from her was really commendable.,We have been consulting Dr. Padmini for over 2 years, right from the time of planning to delivery of our child and I must admit that our experience has been much more than excellent.

Swapna Health Care,Hyderabad,"MBBS, DGO",48,"First and Foremost: I am posting this on behalf of my mother, who successfully delivered me in-spite of having had pregnancy hypertension.. My mother came across this doctor online 30 years later (I was born on July 6th 1989).. She initially did not know that I have a Practo account.. But now that I have told her this, she wants to let people know how highly she recommends Dr. Savitha Devi.. And I personally would like to add this: Thank you Doctor, for bringing me out safe :),Pregnancy and child birth are the biggest things to happen in a couple's life.The choice of hospital for the same,makes it equally big decision to be taken.Havinc suggested by a family member,my husband and I have chosen Swapna Health Care,Begumpet after the initial couple of check ups and we can firmly say there is no regret.For,they provided us with the best health care,necessary comfort,and competent doctors through out.Biggest thanks to each one of the doctors for making the experience totally effortless.We would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for quality maternal health care.,I did not have a pleasant experience. My appointment was at 10:35 in Miyapur branch. They called me and changed the location for Begumpet Branch. I went to Begumpet branch, and had to wait for nearly 3 hrs. At 1:30 pm a junior doctor came and said for go for scanning because the scanning doctor will leave by 2:00 pm ( at this point no internal examination was done) they determined that I needed scanning just like that. I finished scanning by 2:30 pm and again waited for DR. Y. Savitha Devi to come. Then again a junior doctor came and said Dr. Savitha is attending an emergency and DR. Swapna will attend me. I Clearly at old them if Dr. Savitha will not be attending me I would like to have my all money back (₹850 Consultation + ₹2450 Scanning). Then all of sudden they said Dr. Savitha is coming in 10 min and asked me to wait. Dr. Savitha came and looked at the scan report and said every thing looks good in the report and asked me to do a lab work and come back (all this was done in less than 60 sec). Nurse gave me a perscription  and took me to the pharmacist she gave me a bill for ₹4500. There was a special test called GCT for which we have to buy a sugar packet just from them. While buying that packet the pharmacist told me that I have to consume that packet  20 min after breakfast and there should be 2 hrs gap before the sample was drawn( these are the exact words used by the Pharmacist) next day I went after 2 hrs 40 min for the blood sample and the lab technician said that they can't draw the sample, the sample had to be draw before 2 hrs.  I was v. Mad by this time and went to pharmacist and asked her why she didn't explain properly. She bluntly said that it is not her job to do so. Over all It is not the doctors job or the nurses job or the pharmacist job to explain the GCT test process,It was my first visit to a gynaecologist.

I visited a doctor previously and she asked me to go for perinoeotomy. But Dr. Divya counselled me so well about the problem with a thorough pelvis check up. Asked that there is no need of surgery. It was just an infection for which she treated me. And asked me not take any stress. Within a few month I concieved. During pregnancy counselling also she was very friendly. ,One of the major challenges  parents to-be  face is to find a Doctor who can help you have a stress free 9 months of wait. If this is your first child and you are still in the look out for a Doctor your search ends here. Right from the first time we met Dr Divya we coudn't stop but thank her for a stress free time we had and thank God we decided to choose her for our precious little one. Now coming to the most important reason why we chose Dr Divya. Most of us tend to believe Dr Internet even though internet can be informative it can be misleading too, so its important to have a Doctor who can help you take care of the baby and mother through proper medication,diet and most importantly being positive. All of this is what you would find in abundance with Dr Divya, she is informative,approachable,updated and extremely positive and believes in prevention rather than cure. If you follow her instructions you can be rest assured to have a  healthy pregnancy and safe delivery. Even waiting for your turn can be informative as she ensures that there is enough study material on the notice boards and books that will keep you occupied and teach you something new every time you visit her at the clinic. I would recommend DR Divya to every couple on the way to becoming a parent, I am sure that the nine months are something that we should cherish and that is why its imperative to get a Doctor like her who makes it possible.

I am very hesitant to opt for a surgery as I heard many scary stories such as the wound not getting healed or surgery failing or leading it to other complications. I opted different non surgical treatments and tried all 3 approaches. Allopathy, ayurveda and homoeopathy. Also  tried to ""manage"" the problem for years through sitz baths, fibre diets and drinking lots of water. Despite all this, I used to have very painful bowel movements every now and then. Also this effected my lifestyle a lot as I need to be cautious on everything I do and I eat.  After prolonged delay and aggravating my problem,  I thought enough is enough and decided to face the final option, surgery. Then I started looking for a doctor and consulted many. To my fortune I came across Dr Anand Kumar and on my very first consultation itself, I got full confidence that I met the right doctor. He is very friendly and listens you with care and patience. All my fears of surgery are gone and I was more willing to opt for it. The procedure went for 30 mins to 1 hour and I stayed in hospital for 2 days. The 1st week post surgery is a painful one but after the 2nd week onwards I noticed considerable progress in healing. The entire healing took a month or two but there is no more pain. No more worry of stepping into a toilet. All this happen an year ago and today I am totally fissure free. Thanks to Dr Anand. I am immensely indebted you.,jan 18, 2018,Not knowing how to star and were to star because he is not a doctor anymore to me, he and his team are my family members. We cannot share about our family in just few words in the same way it is not easy to share few words about Ananda Sir and his treatment. Anand sir treat his patients as his own family member and gives important to each and every small problem they suffer and will take care of their pain as mother takes care of her children and will make us feel better. A mother never think of time when her children are in pain in the same way Ananda Sir never think of time when we are in pain. Really doctors are God because first importance they give to patient which is very very very important thing doctor should do and Ananda Sir always does that. He never make us feel that we are talking to a doctor, he just talk to us as a family member that is enough for a patient to get confidence, that everything will be cured. Confidence will reduce half the disease of a patient is what I strongly believe, which is very rare thing, which is been given by doctor to their patient. I have suffered a lot in past with different health issues and have been demotivated many times, after meeting Anand Sir, I never even taught or worried about my health and got confidence and got my health and my smile back which I missed many years without even knowing that I have missed it, Ananda sir hand have some power is what I feel.

I'm totally out of words to explain how I kept struggling for almost 2 YEARS with this pain managing my baby, home, travels and above all entire day sitting in an IT job. A friend referred me to Dr. Anjali and within a week of , diagnosis, I started experiencing improvement in my plight. Her diagnosis began with identification of Vitamin D deficiency in me, which sadly no gynae or ortho could suggest in past 2 years. After a treatment of close to 3 months, she made me sit on my butt without any oooh, aaah and ouchs. The best part of the treatment was, she didn't touch my tail bone even once. She taught me how my tail bone (Coccydynia) was not the main problem but symptom of something even more gross happening inside my body. The main culprit was Pelvic Misalignment. She thoroughly educated me about the muscles and the hormones playing role in pelvic alignment and not only corrected it for me but also taught me the pain management ways to keep it correct and under control. ,I Joshua, a foreign national with highly educated and medical background, Dr Anjali is hands-down one of the BEST Physiotherapist i have seen in my 30 years of life! Her demeanor and listening manner is calm, positive, thorough, attentive, flexible, and personal. I consulted her due to my lumbar l3 l4 slipped disc issue causing back pain and i was advised for an immediate surgery in the previous hospital i visited but i took a step back and wanted to do more consultation. I came about Dr Anjali Agarwal and i was assured no immediate or probably later surgery is not needed, all i need is to work on the muscles to heal the pain and slipped disc may push back in as time goes on. She referred me to a spine surgeon in a reputable hospital in Hyderabad for a second opinion which said the same thing. Dr Anjali Agarwal made me feel comfortable and relaxed and asked me questions about my recreational life (which no doctor has ever done before!). we also discussed Healthy spices to relax the muscles to eradicate the pains and some life phase events and she made recommendations as to what i need. I find that doctors usually are distracted or rushed when visiting their patients, but not with Dr. Anjali Agarwal. I had the sense that this doctor REALLY cared about my whole being and not just the fact that i needed a physical exam and some other work done. Additionally i could tell that Dr. Anjali Agarwal has a well-rounded medical background and approaches her care with a western and Southern perspective, not the typical medical “fix it and get rid of it” approach. It is for this reason plus i am 90% free from the pain which is far better than before because it is a continuous process and the fact that her receptionist was very friendly and welcoming, that i give her 5 stars! I would definitely recommend this practice to anyone that values their health and wants a doctor (Physiotherapist) that’s holistic, empowering, and a true team player!,I went to Dr Anjali after seeing her good reviews and a long experience as physiotherapist and i think i got the treatment i was expecting. I will definitely recommend her if someone is having Back pain and Neck pain.,Anjali Agarwal has been a terrific physio! I had torn shoulder tendons ",300,Dr. Anjali Agarwal   (Physiotherapist),5.0,Physiotherapist

Mallareddy Narayana,Hyderabad,"MBBS, MS - Orthopaedics",15,"hello everyone... I'am Satya . prior to the surgery i was suffering with recurrent shoulder dislocation.. 6 times on the whole. I got it checked by Dr. Venumadhav and Dr. anjani kumar and was advised to undergo a surgery (shoulder arthroscopy)   I fixed the date of surgery and got admitted in the hospital 12 hrs prior to the surgery( a night before the surgery) . The following day i was asked not to have breakfast..not even water ( i sipped a little though) . around 8:30 am i was taken to the OT and was questioned about my shoulder history .. then came the team of anesthetists . senior anesthetist wanted to give it in a sitting position .. so he asked me to sit with my back straight and stuck a syringe in my neck and put me to sleep. then came the team of doctors as mentioned above and performed the surgery. few hours later i woke up in Antarctica which was apparently the ICU with a numb hand. first two days were not so good .. the pain was something i hadn't experienced before. I was checked on by both the surgeon's once a day until i got discharged . They strictly told me to wear the shoulder immobilizer  all the time until a period of 4 weeks post surgery .10 days post operation i was asked to visit the doctor for removal of stitches .  until 3 weeks after surgery i did not move my shoulder much . 21 days post surgery i started physio therapy and not even 3 weeks later my shoulder is doing great.  i would definitely recommend Mr. Venumadhav and Mr. anjani kumar for all kinds of joints related issues. I would also like to recommend Mr. Srikanth physio therapist . He is  professional as well as dedicated towards what he does and most importantly  a very friendly person . NOTE : this review has been written 40 days post surgery .  ,First we we're glad that there wasn't too much waiting when we came to visit the doctor. Came here for my mother who had a wrist sprain, which I felt was probably a fracture. Intial clinical observation from the doctor was it might be a minor crack on the muscle. So he suggested for an x-ray. The waiting for x-ray was very long. As they were giving priority to in-patients. After waiting for an hour for the x-ray we quickly went back to the doctor, he said x-ray shows a fracture and have to do a minor surgery for bone alignment. The doctor was very friendly and was answering all the questions we had, very patiently. ,Hi,,IAM MAHINDER WORKING AS A BUSSINESSMAN.I  have pain in my right shoulder from past 2yrs. i consulted DR VENUMADHAV for my problom.doctor advised for MRI .in that posterosuperiorlabrum tear with multi ocular para labral cystic changes noted. doctor done surgery for my above condition succesfully. now iam totally pain free with no restriction of movements. i will strongly recomend  DR VENUMADHAV.

Sri Visista Super Speciality Ayurveda,Hyderabad,"MD - Ayurveda Medicine, BAMS",36,"We were 5 of us who went to visit this Doctor for the first time. We heard of him that he is known as the Guru of Ayurveda Doctors. We found that people from various places across states in India are visiting him taking the time and effort to travel all the way. That itself gave us a great confidence that we have come to a right place. Later when we had our conversations with the doctor, everybody had a smile on their faces because, the doctor not only has addressed all the issues, but has given a moral strength that we don't have to think that our diseases will last forever and that there is a cure for everything. His approval to our concerns was very practical and did not promise us anything supernatural of curing overnight. But yes, they will get cured, given the right time and patience, overall, a positive thinking that the medicine is working for you. He takes time to listen patiently and shows great empathy towards every patient's pain. We see a great change and relief in our symptoms already with two days of medication out of 21days course. We all recommend all to make a visit to this doctor for any kind of concern. God bless this Doctor!!!,Very nice experience with Dr. Venkataiah ....

In a day’s time I was able to see difference in my health. I would definitely recommend him.,I would like to share a detailed feedback so that it helps people  suffering from a similar condition and looking out for some help. My pain had started sometime in July 2015 and it became worse sometime September which is when I visited an orthopetician. I was suggested to go for a physiotherapy. I went to a physiotherapist (don't want to mention name) and was given TFT treatment for about 2weeks which gave me a temporary relief but after 2 weeks my pain had aggravated and then I was again suggested to show to an ortho. The ortho did several tests, gave me medicines for about 3-4 months which did not show any improvement. Then he had given me an injection post which my movement of shoulder got restricted along with aggregating the pain. I was then asked to go for a surgery . I was really scared about the situation and almost lost hope that I would get back my shoulder to normal without pain. Then I found Dr Vinay Kumar in practo sometime in Feb 2016 with very good feedback and review. Considering him as my last hope I had come with all my reports. He patentitly listened to me understood the situation and started the treatment. We started initially with physio and then through research found that there could be improvement in terms of pain through sccupunture and we started with it. After 3 sessions of accupunture I started seeing some improvement so we continued it for some more time and after 10 odd sessions of accupunture I got releived of my pain completely and then started with physio sessions and  now in July my shoulder  movement is 90% back to normal wit no pain at all . my last hope worked and I am very happy because I am able to do things normally without any struggle and pain. Iam writing this because this might help people suffering from the same problem and yes Dr Vinay is their doctor .,I had such terrible chest pain suffered from 3 days  with just one sitting at Dr Vinay's clinic i am so much better i could not sleep for almost a week had pain when lying down but yesterday slept so peacefully had no discomfort at all in fact I was in lot of pain at his clinic as well i just could not lie down but after his therapy felt very relieved was a bit worried when time came to sleep if pain would occur but nothing till now , he does wonders and knows exactly what the problem is and will guide the patient accordingly, he is very patient as well and gives time to the patient a breather which i appreciated it was so painful for me I was scared but he makes you feel relaxed and diverts your mind from the pain which also helps in the therapy process.,I was suffering with severe neck pain from past two years but aggravated from 6 months very badly. So bad that I had to quit my job. The pain was not only in the neck but it spread all over my face. It used to hurt all around my eyes even for small distance travel on my bike. Pain was further shooting to my jaw, back of neck, headaches, even I had severe nose pain which all seemed very strange to me. I met few doctors & used medicines but didn't work even a bit. I tried Naatu ( Local village ) treatment , didn't work. Somehow I was passing through Dr. Vinay's clinic one day & happen to meet him.

He is well experience in understanding the problem with root cause and treats them accordingly. For me the problem was at minor level but the treatment i got was the best. I feel i have chosen the best option without experiencing the bitter  part of allopathy. Surgery definitely leaves some side effect to our body, that could be minor/major. when things can be settled without surgery better to go for that. Ksarsutra definitely have no/minimal side effect, compared to traditional surgeries. Specially fistula is a must to treat case, as it doesn't go on its own. Cost wise also less in ayurveda compared to surgery.Again, I can't define fees wise, as it depends on individual capacity, for me it was ok as some portion of it covered under insurance.

Tru Dental Care,Hyderabad,"BDS, MDS - Conservative Dentistry & Endodontics",9,"My appointment and check-up at Tru Dent headed by Dr. Jitender Reddy has been a very pleasant experience. Post the check-up, my overall dental health has improved. Wherever possible, Dr. Jitender had preferred the natural methods and avoided unwanted procedures. He always resorts to minimally invasive techniques and would only performs a major one unless it is really essential. He thoroughly examined medical history before prescribing medicines. His tips, though small made significant difference and improved my dental health. He had patiently responded to all my queries and concerns. I am very confident about his diagnosis and he has got a trained eye of a periodontal specialist and makes proper assessment of your dental and gum health and picks up on hidden and early warning signs. I would definitely like to recommend to anyone who is in search of a good and trustworthy dentist.,I have been here at Tru Dent Care on 28th Sep 2019 for getting my tooth caries removed along with deep cleaning. My first experience when I entered the premises was cleanliness and I deeply appreciate the statutory rule of leaving the footwear outside. It was a rainy day and still the clinic was very clean and neatly maintained. And I met Dr.Jitender Reddy with a prior appointment and he explains everything in detail and I admire his rich experience in diagnosing the problem and all of the problems were duly noted by another doctor and a precise treatment was carried out in a step by step manner and that made me very comfortable on the dentist chair. He doesnt do anything extra unless it is strictly needed and he is a doctor who also listens to his patients. He is a young talented doctor with a very stable hands and I know this because I have been operated on. Coming to the equipment, this is purely based on my observation. I could see all the filing equipment/add-ons were handpicked by the doctor based on the location of the caries to reach every nook and corner to surgically remove the carries as well as the calculus without grinding off the healthy enamel and I strongly believe that he has that experience in picking and using the right tool with finesse is his forte, my entire treatment including deep cleaning was done in 50 Mins and my teeth look pristine after the treatment. And the pain is very minimal thats the reason I say, stable hands ! Like the premises, even the equipment is sterile and he wore an odourless blue nitrile gloves when I was getting operated on. There is also a DLSR which is no fancy item and it takes Hi-Res pictures of the caries and caries legion, which is further illustrated, classified and explained by the doctor and it gave me an in-depth understanding of the problem and also the preventive measures are clearly explained as well. Overall, I am very happy with my treatment and I left the clinic on a very positive note. Even the cost is very reasonable, I know this because I come from a family of doctors. This is my honest review and I hope my review helps. In the end, I would like to thank all the Tru Dent Care team and specially Dr. Jitender Reddy for keeping me very comfortable during the treatment and making it a big success.,Had very good experience with tru dental care clinic. Clinic was extremely well maintained and highly equipped. Dr. Jitender is very professional and explains all the problems so clearly.

We had informed her that we were present for the treatment and not for a consult since all the diagnosis was done on the first visit. She insisted we pay the consultation fee and only then can we enter the doctor's cabin. We very politely put it across to her again that we would like to speak with the doctor first and make all the payments if she says so. Firstly, the chemical peel treatment which is a yellow retinol peel that the doctor suggested for acne marks , hence the reason for which i needed to just speak to her first. When i explained the same the receptionist said ""How wouldn't it work? That's not possible, there are so many patients who are here"", as if she held a PhD degree in dermatology. Now, during all the commotion, the lady passes on a comment to another staff member that we refused to pay the money which we never said. She spoke about rules, her duty and was adamant i first pay the consultation fee to enter the doctors cabin. I wouldn't have made it an issue about it as we were paying money for the treatment already and a mere 500 would'nt have been a problem. Its the staff's behavior and the way she treated the clients at the clinic which made us walk away from the clinic.

All the procedure charges were taken before only and then the patient is left for waiting. When at 4:30 PM she called me for my turn. Still she was’t there in the laser room. I already told her that i have my obligations too and have to reach somewhere at 5. So, now she didn’t come till 5:03 approx. trying to start the laser machine which did not work.

So we visited him and we are surprised to see the cure in 2 weeks. Now my mother and all the family members are relaxed. Thank you sir... You really made a difference in my family with your treatment.,The best thing about Dr. Chendrayudu is he would listen. I had been to a couple of dermatologists earlier, but their treatment of acne more or less seemed to treat it as cosmetic remedy.

When I went to consult my gynaecologist and said about my problem, they said this is due to PUPPS and this kind of itching is common in pregnancy and no treatment for this.

My itching problem went worse and I visited good corporate hospitals , but no luck. I can not even describe the pain I suffered . Finally by God’s grace, I met Doctor Uday Kiran and he immediately after seeing the issue , said the itching is due to scabies.

For its treatment, I have have visited several doctors in and outside Hyderabad, but I could not get permanent solution for the disease..  I feel very lucky to have found Dr. Venkat., But what stands out for me about Dr. Venkat is, the time he gives to every patient. He is ready to answer each and every question of the patient in detail. His passion to serve the patient is unparalleled. Of course he gives the medicines, but at the same time, he wants the patient to be aware of the cause of the disease and what lifestyle changes he/she should make so as to get rid the the disease.  Now, after taking medicines from Dr. Venkat, the severity of the disease has lessened to a great extent, and I am sure that I would be cured completely. If anyone wants to try Ayurveda , I request you to go to Dr. Venkat once. I am sure you would not regret.  May your tribe increase, Dr. Venkat.,Nice doctor n reasonable mefication as of today.  My sister also treated with back pain n now doing fine,Iam Suresh Kumar from Begumpet, Secunderabad. I was suffering from Lower back ache from the last 2years with dragging pain from Lower back to left leg. I consulted top most Neuro physicians, Surgeon's as well as Orthopaedicins. My condition was diagnosed as Lumbar Disc Bulge compressing Sciatic Nerve and was recommended to go for surgery. Mean while suggested me some oral medication & physiotherapy. Nothing had given relief from pain. I was searching for Alternate Treatments. One of my colleagues suggested me to consult Dr.Krishna Naik who is an Ayurvedic Physician. At first I hesitated as my case is related to surgery and physician will not be of any help. But since my pain was troubling me a lot, I decided to consult him and try once. When I made a call to take appointment, Dr himself attented my call and spoke very friendly and asked me to visit his clinic once. I consulted him at his clinic. The clinic atmosphere was very good and made me feel comfortable. He examined my Back and assessed my condition well and explained me what was happening at my lower back that is making me feel discomfort. I was very much satisfied with his way of explaining the condition. He examined my Pulse and suggested me diet which suits my body constitution. I was very much happy the way he treats his patients. His explanation cleared all my doubts. I took some medication for 1 month and almost I got 70% relief from pain. Later he suggested me some Detoxificatory procedures for 10days. Now iam very much comfortable with my health. I would say iam 100% free from my Sciatica condition. Thank you Dr. Krishna.  Right now iam taking some medicine so called Disc strengthening medicine as suggested by the Dr,I would highly recommend Dr.Krishna Naik MD for those who are suffering from Back ache issues. ,His analysis of the patient's body constitution is commendable. Instead of merely prescribing medicines, he also recommends a lifestyle that would eventually help in freeing you from the dependence on medicines for better health.

KPHB Physiotherapy Clinic,Hyderabad,"Masters Of Physiotheraphy, BPTh/BPT",19,"I started visiting Dr.Nagaraju in July, 2016 after receiving a doctor’s referral for physiotherapy to help me relieve an ongoing pain I had in my left forearm. Prior to seeing Dr.Nagaraju, the pain was chronic and so debilitating that I could not lift anything of a significant weight  (i.e. a bag of vegitables) with that arm. Consequently, my performance at the work deteriorated and I noticed that I was losing my stamina, strength and energy. My sleep was also compromised because I was not keeping myself as fit as I would like and the pain was so great, it would keep me awake at night. Since seeing Dr.Nagaraju on a regular basis, I am amazed at how much I have improved. Through the use of ultrasound, ift, stretches, exercises and use of equipment, he improved not only the condition of my arm, but also the range of motion and flexibility in my neck and shoulders as well as my posture. Consequently, the pain that was once in my forearm is now gone and I have surpassed its original level strength as I am now able to lift more weight at the gym. My stamina and energy have also improved and my sleep has returned to normal as I no longer wake up with pain. Dr.Nagaraju was always very patient and professional as he calmly took me through each exercise, describing its reason for inclusion, goal and proper mechanics. He answered any questions I had and used his professional expertise to help me program my gym workouts so that I could achieve maximum results without further injury.,""I'm kabaddi player and participated competitively. I sustained a herniated disc at L4/L5 and L5/S1 level. I had severe pain in the glutes and hamstring area with restricted movement of my left hip and weakness in my left leg. I went to 2 different doctors, 1 claiming to be a spine specialist. Both of them were very demotivating, telling me to rest - no activities whatsoever for a couple of weeks and to give up my sport. That's the worst thing any athlete would ever hear. I went for 3 sessions physio at another centre and my pain was excruciatingly worse post physio with no progress. That's when I found this physio clinic in KPHB colony. I was treated by Dr.Nagaraju. And by the second session he managed to diagnose my problem. After the 3rd session my pain reduced significantly and I was able to carry out my daily activities without painkillers (I was on 3 very strong painkillers). ,Treatment Received:,my mother 57 yr, having frozen shoulder since 6 months, she was unable to do her daily activities, Ortho doctors advised physio for 1 month vigorously.",300,Dr. C.

She is very clear and methodical in her ways and starts out with a definitive plan of treatment with an end point. She helped me and my spouse with marital counselling and practically saved my marriage.  As a therapist for my depression her availability is a blessing.  I have never once been in a situation to have not been able to reach her which gives me a lot of faith and confidence in the treatment.  ,Dr.Purnima is rather commercial and money minded  than  professional,  Recently I had been to her Banjara hills clinic for a minor psychological problem (regret feeling). simply she advised some breathing exercises and asked me to come for a second sitting to give advise for the problem. for this simple consultation she charged Rs.1500/- which is very high. for this fees i neither got a useful advise nor any tips for my problem. depending upon the patient's financial status she is charging the fees without any useful advise to the patient. for simple breathing exercises charging Rs.1500/- is very high and i felt as if my pocket has been cut. for any doctor the consultation fee will be fixed and it will be valid for 10 days. here there is no such facility and the fees is to the doctor's whims and fancies.hope this practise will be dispensed with.",1000,Dr. Purnima Nagaraja,3.5,Psychiatrist

Had a really wonderful experience, when I was told by a couple of dentists that I have to let go my tooth. Finally a friend of mine in my office suggested tom consult with Dr Radhika. I decided to try to give it a shot and found that not even once did she talk about extracting the tooth. Her focus seemed to be on saving the tooth - seems like she gives the best and honest advice. I had a very good impression in the first meeting itself. Since then there is no stopping, no words to thank her for the level of comfort she has been delivering to her patients.The root canal was completely painless, the bridge is functioning very well.

Himagiri Hospitals,Hyderabad,"MBBS, DNB - Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery",10,"I am dissatisfied with the way the receptionists have treated us. I had booked the appointment to meet the doctor at 11.10 am which was very much confirmed by the hospital receptionist. But around 9.30am I got a call saying that Dr. Madhusudan is not available, instead we can consult Dr. Prashant between 12 noon to 1pm. So we thought of reaching the hospital by 12.30pm and we got into our personal work. But at 11.30 am again we got a call saying that the doctor would be available till 12 noon at the max., because of which, we had to abandon our personal work midway and rush to the hospital. I am considerate enough to understand the fact that the doctor might have got to go for a.camp all of a sudden, but the irony of the entire episode is that the hospital staff were not apologetic in their tone and were behaving in a high handed manner because there was a great amount of risk involved in reaching the hospital as well our work had to be abandoned midway. This is happening to me the second time. Just that the hospital is near my office and if there comes a need for the follow up or tests results to be collected, I preferred this hospital. Otherwise I definitely would not. And the fee they charge is applicable only for a week, but the doctor usually ask us to visit after a week. So practically speaking, you end up paying the consultation fee everytime you visit. I personally feel that the fee should be applicable for 2 weeks or atleast 10 days.,Most friendly doctor and explains the disease process very well. I would happily recommend him for orthopedic problems.,First thing consultation period is only a week and when we call the hospital ,they simply say doctor is in surgery and will not be available and for the next visit they charge you again. , You guys have to concern about the patient and his time.,Pathheetic experience.

Gleneagles Global Hospital,Hyderabad,"MBBS, MD - General Medicine, DM - Gastroenterology",29,"Doctor dharmesh is good and experience. He knows how to solve problems of stomach,etc,.I refer Doctor Dharmesh specially for Stomach.,He exactly knows what actually you need at that time. From day one of my operation i am enjoying it. I had Liver cirrhosis due to some unknown reason.,I was referred to Dr: Dharmesh Kapoor (Gleneagles Global Hospitals, Hyderabad) by another doctor( Dr: Nutakki Sridhar, Guntur) for specific treatment of liver. During blood test, my previous doctor found out that my liver enzymes are elevated mildly. To be specific ALT=76, AST=46,CRP:10.8. I have no specific liver problems, other than mildly elevated enzymes. My ultrasound sound scan was perfectly normal.  I went to Dr Dharmesh Kapoor and explained the issue. He asked about my daily routine and asked me to undergo auto-immune tests. I have done them and all results are negative. Then he asked me to undergo liver biopsy to understand the problem. I have undergone liver biopsy too. The results are negative. Atlast he said these mildly elevated enzymes are no problem and your liver is safe as anyone. I was happy and went back to my first doctor. My only problem( after I realized) is with liver biopsy. It is an invasive procedure and should be used sparingly. Several doctors only recommends this procedure only when liver enzymes elevate to the levels higher than 500 and after a clear indication in ultra sound scan. But this is not followed in my case. Apart from loss of money and time, liver biopsy has also lot of side effects which is exactly my concern. I am having digestive issues and lower back pain consistently as side effects. ,I strongly believe that Doctor Dharmesh Kapoor with all his experience knew about this and still went ahead with the procedure. I wish I would've been smarter and have taken second advice before undergoing the procedure. , But anyways, I can't go back and turn the clock back.,So please be careful when visiting this doctor and confirm any tests only after trusted second advice. The least thing I can do is share my experience here and help patients like me. Other than this I have no benefit . I hope you understand and don't suffer like me. Thanks,we went to Global Hospital only beacuse of Dr. Mohammed Rela. Heard that he is the best liver transplant surgeon. Dr. Dharmesh was my dads doctor. He spoke well, though I dont know about the goodness of the medical treatment he offered. My dad eventually went into a Coma. I had been telling the doctor and his team that my dad is confused. They have been writing it in their Medical record also, but they took it lightly inspite of it being a known fact that liver patients can go into encephalopathy. One of the signs of this is mental confusion which they just avoided. And his team is really wierd and they talk bad about each oher in front of the patients, may be they thought we dont understand marathi. Dr Lata, second in line to Dr. Dharmesh is very rude. She told us infront of my dad( though he was in a coma) that there is a 200 percent chance that he would not recover and she was so confident that she said she could give it in writing. I dont know if she is even a human being. Dr dharmesh if your relative was the patient how would you feel if the Treating doctor talks like this to you in front of your ailing relative. She was right. My dad did not survive the treatment which this best hospital was offering. But doctors are treated like God and this is not how God behaves. She should not have said it in the first place. and even she wanted to, she should have had the basic ethics and courtesy of calling us outside. And one kind of treatment was being given, but they were discussing in front of us about an alternative treatment which could be more succesful, but since Dr Dharmesh was against it they could not go ahead with it. If the team doesnt have unity and if they discuss all this in front of the patients how would we feel that we are at a safe place.  And we had been asked to go back to our hometown as they said the chances are pretty low. But they also said that if he improves you can get him back for the transplant. and i have seen the dr. sending home 2 patienst because he said the chances are pretty slim. So basically he takes only those cases which will be successfull so that his career graph does not go down and they are also after money. I dont know if my review will help anyone or not. But those of you who are reading, please avoid this hospital. The nurses in the night duty are so absent minded. The night my dad went to coma , he had bouts of vomitting which started at around 6 in the evening. But the nurse just kept on giving anti vomit injections. The duty doctor came in the morning at 6am. And in another instance, one of the nurses gave me the tablets  to be given after dinner. Only one tablet og Gutron 2.5mg was given. I told her that in the morning and afternoon, the nurse had given me 3 of those tablets. She said No its only one. Upon my insistence she checked and said sorry I did not check the dosage. My dad was advised 7.5mg. This is how careless they are with patients in step down ICU. I can only wonder what happens to the others.",800,Dr. Dharmesh Kapoor,4.0,Gastroenterologist

She told me that i have Pneumonia and it was quite elevated by then(not being given the right treatment earlier). She treated me for a week and I felt better. I am still getting treated by her for my Tuberculosis and get amazed every time I visit her for the review. She explains the problem and the solution with great clarity. She is crisp and to the point. Love the way she deals with her patients. When you are physically ill for a long time it hits you emotionally too.

The senior doctor is aware of patient conditipn and she cannot be moved and hence the family members are struggling for second advice. When i met Dr. MVT without any initial discussion he shouted the sister why the files are not separated when they have come without patient. I deeply felt bad about that as i personally know that the patient is in coma since more than 10 days (by the time when i met to see this Dr. for second opinion. They should remember first they are human beings then they can proceed with conversation to either patient or his attendant. I am not expecting anything out of the way.

I always dream of going to UK which was my dream and I had to work and put a lot of effort to achieve that, however due to some external factor I had to come to India for a week and that one week became a month and I had to stay back in India, my whole world came crumbling down as that was my dream, I had to take up a call center job and that time I had not even thought in my wildest dream that I would be working in a call center after spending so much time and money, I had lost interest in life and career and was constantly frustrated with myself and my spouse as she did not support my idea of going back, and then she introduced me to Mr. Karthik Madugula, I thought lets humor her request as I never believed in visiting counselor, so after meeting him I see that he was young and you can feel that you are not talking to a counselor but some one who you can relate to, he was quite open with what he said and I was able to open up with him and vent my frustration, after my first visit I was like okay now I visited  I know what to do, however he took time to visit me at my place and gave regular guidance and motivation, he gave me good examples of situation where he was able to take control of things and let bad emotions go, he showed me a clear perspective on life and encouraged me to take up more activities, after 2 months of meeting him my first change was my appearance, I was at 85 KG and I came down to 75 KG, the motivation which I got forced me to prove that I can do something, now I have different outlook and have 2 to 3 options open and am confident that I can go forward in life with the motto ""if you think and put effort you can"". I want to conclude by saying that Karthik is not someone who is fantastic or some one who has a magic want to make your problems disappear, but he is your regular guy who you will be able to relate to and some one who can show you the path to approach life, thanks again for the help !! ,I think lists are more readable that paragraphs so below am listing all the things I absolutely admire about my life coach: ,I had a terrible marriage and I went into depression. I was in chaos and lacked direction. I accepted unacceptable things in my marriage just for the sake of saving it and was not completely ready to go for divorce. Lies, betrayal, violence was​ common in my marriage and I was not ready to discuss the most crucial part that I was married to a person of different sexual orientation. I was emotionally involved and was not ready to accept that my marriage was unsustainable. I tried to do everything but I failed. And I was also devastated by​ the ​continuous infidelity by my husband. My in-laws​ were also torturing me with all possible ways from verbal to physical abuse. I was completely​ broken​. But still, ​I had no courage to come out of the agony I was living in. Then I met Karthik and I am glad that I decided to take sessions from him. He unlocked all the confusions and dilemma​ I had and gave me direction. Even he was available on messages and calls at midnight to help me out with my emotional trouble. He helped me to understand that my marriage was unsustainable and also helped me to accept the reality which I didn't want to accept. Married to a person with different sexual orientation and weird​ sexual desires ruins you and your existence. And the​ marriage becomes a nightmare. Even I have accepted the brutal beating by my husband. I don't think I would be able to describe the pain and torture I have gone through in words. Karthik started giving me clarity and direction. He answered all my queries and helped me to see a future without my husband. After taking sessions from Karthik I decided to go for divorce and that was the right decision of my life. And now I am happy and at peace with myself​ and my surroundings. I have clarity and direction in my life. Karthik makes himself​ available for his patients 24/7 and helps​ them in decision making., I wish him good luck for his future​. ,I have attended 4 sessions till now and visiting Dr Karthik has always been a good experience.",1500,Mr. Karthik Madugula,5.0,Psychologist

Ziva Embryology And Fertility Institute,Hyderabad,MA - Psychology,13,"I met Dr. Pushpa first time 5years back at Nova and I happend to find her through Practo and consulted her at Ziva. Now I have consulted her for my emotional wellbeing. I was able to make great progress for my mental health condition through my therapy sessions with her. Dr. Pushpa provided an excellent service particularly through using CBT techniques and I noticed a significant improvement in my mental health condition following each session. She is very friendly and empathetic which worked well for my recovery. ,I attended counselling sessions with her and she really helped me out with anxiety issues and self discovery. She always tries to get to your level of understanding in order to make sure you are feeling comfortable and can relate to the advice she is offering. Dr. Pushpa is very friendly and I immediately felt very comfortable during our first session itself. She was able to point out the exact issues that caused the anxiety I had been facing, and offered excellent advice in order to help me deal with it. Thanks to her, I'm a much more confident person who is happier in her own skin. Thank you, ma'am! ,We are trying for a Baby since 3 to 4 years and could not conceive on due to late marriage and my stress levels, besides my Husband also much obsessed to become father, finally we opted to consult any Psychologist to overcome from my stress, anxiety and explained my family issues and other concerns to Pushpa madam...., Initially my husband denied me for psychology consultation, but after attending few sessions then we realized the importance of psychology sessions as madam taught me how to deal with family problems and divert the mind to good mood swings... Pushpa madam completely listens from both side of us and gave suitable advises to both of us..., we attended 2 to 3 sessions per week until 3 months and relation between me & my husband improved and today i got my pregnancy as positive...,I met Dr. Pushpa for sexual counseling, We are married for 5 years now and we never had any physical intimacy. I have been to many gynaecologists but it was never resolved. I got to know about Dr. Pushpa from one of my friends and I went to visit her. She listened to our problem very patiently and she understood our problem and suggested psychotherapy for my wife. She suggested us for 6-8 sessions. But with in 4 sessions only our problem was resolved. My wife has got no pain anymore and she is relaxed",800,Ms. Pushpa Ragaveni Buddana,5.0,Psychologist
Retrospect Counselling,Hyderabad,Post Graduate Diploma in Psychological Counseling,3,"Doctor's honest and friendly approach was very helpful.,She's a lovely person who has amazing skills ,every session is reassuring and satisfactory.,One of the basic tenets of a professional counsellor is the ability to make the client comfortable and relaxed. As only when a person is comfortable and relaxed, will he be open to speak freely about what’s bothering him. To softly and surely nudge him towards exploring himself is the epitome of a counsellor. It’s a self realisation journey which is concluded through the able hands of a determined and confident counsellor .. I would suggest that she is one of the best. The eaziness with which she identified my problem, made me understand the same and also helped me with the simplest but effective solutions has created a very positive impact on me and . I'm  very thankful to her.,Doc Sneha does her job splendidly well,the moment i reached the place i was bit hesitant as it was my first experience but she and her hubby were very caring and friendly and when i was finished and was about to leave  i felt i could win this war in my head of being anxious on non important stuff,she made me realize that i am missing out on things which means a lot and made a new me in that process.Very glad to have met.",1000,Ms. Sneha Khelani,,Psychologist

Acro,Hyderabad,"BA - Psychology, Masters in Psychology",5,"I have had the fortune to know Aishwarya for quite a few years now, and we have been good friends since college. When I visited her in lieu of certain psychological problems that I was striving with, she knew a little bit about my history of those and counselled me accordingly. As a friend she has helped me through and thin, and as a doctor she did a splendid job at that as well. It's fair to say that I was surprised to see her deal with me as a patient rather than a friend, and that enriched my experience, as a whole. She didn't let any bias cloud her approach and she did what she is dead on good at; counsel a patient. ,I was depressed long ago, due to some issues going on in my life. I didn't know how to deal with this issue at that time. There was a lot to process, it did take a toll over my health as well. I didn't know the concept of talking about things or basically didn't have any clue how to deal with the depression. She was there all the while it went on for almost a year back then. The friendliness factor really did help me a lot, I could open up about the whole episode which I really needed. I was having panic attacks and the anxiety episodes a lot, The counselling sessions really were of great help. Thanks to her I could regain my grip back to normalcy. ,Ms. Krishna Priya, I thank you from the bottom of my heart to have helped me during my suffering. I really appreciate your kind, attentive, respectful, thoughtful nature. There have been times when you seemed harsh in explaining situations/concerns but that has what has helped me over the past couple of months. I understand how valuable life is now under your guidance. I would definitely recommend you in my circles, and after taking a lot of your time and sessions I can say that it is not a wrong thing to visit a Psychologist when we need space, time, and someone to vent out to. I hope you have a great career ahead! True fan! ,KP Maam was super in her treatment, not only was she friendly but she also made me feel at home . Three sessions with her and I already feel good. Recommending her to friends who need help. The best part about this was that she’s super young and understands our problems more than other “senior” doctors. Totally happy and content with my course from her. ",1500,Ms. Aishwarya Krishna Priya,4.5,Psychologist

And very good and professional therapists and front desk's way of receiving me was simply superb. ,I consult with dr madhavi. She analyse my hair condition nd scalp then she suggest me the customized treatment. Now i took 4 sessions. I very happy with CS.  ,I got by baby’s ear piercing done on October31st,2019 at 7:00pm. It was observed on the same day that right ear piercing was not done  on the marked spot. It was informed to the available staff immediately regarding the same, they misguided us saying that they would redo it once the hole is completely closed without charging me on my revisit. But today when I enquired today and book an appointment the doctor mentioned she’d be charging me again. This’s totally unfair.",500,Dr. Madhavi Chowdary,,Cosmetologist

DHI,Delhi,"MBBS, MD - Dermatology",15,"Dr. Ajay Dubey was very friendly and professional from day 1 to the day i stepped out of the clinic after the hair transplant procedure. He explained me the problem very patiently and did everything to help me make an informed decision. ,The consultation was great with Dr. Ajay Dubey. But what actually hooked me was his ability to give me desired results during the procedure. He is a good artist too. Everybody can make tall claims during the consultation but to be able to really execute them is a work of genius. ,Had a hair transplant done at DHI Delhi clinic a year ago and I’m more than just satisfied with the results today. My case was not that easy and I thank Dr. Dubey for taking all the pains to ensure me the desired hairline. ,Understanding of the procedure is very important for an effective treatment.

"First Eat Right Clinic,First Eat Right Clinic,First Eat Right Clinic,First Eat Right Clinic,First Eat Right Clinic- Jayanagar 4 Block,First Eat Right Clinic - Koramangala",Bangalore,MSc. - Dietetics & Food Service Management,24,"I was trying hard to loose weight but was not getting any results.I was always thinking, avoiding rice, sweets and doing heavy workout is needed to loose weight. But this is not so true. ,I thought weight loss is a myth, till I met Dr. Nafisa. I had tried many diet plans and many suggestions for almost 4 years but none of them worked. Then i thought of giving  a try with professional Dietitian and found First eat right rated well in many online reviews. I met the doctor and opted for 3 month support plan for 17k, which they have mentioned in their website too. ,It was always about feeling healthy, energetic and be within normal BMI range. My first meeting with Dr. Nafeesa convinced me very well on her approach to meet my lifestyle as well as continue to remain fit after the course ends.  Thank you Dr. Nafeesa and team!!,Dr.Nafeesa's diet was very helpful. I lost close to 15 Kgs over a period of 5 months. I had a lot of doubts in mind when i started. It took me a week to get adjusted to my new diet pattern but i followed it as per the suggession along with the workouts. The best part of it was that all that was prescribed was from what i could make at home on a regular basis based on our cuisine and culture & i think thats what made it sustainable as i didn't have to make anything different for myself. I come from a vegetarian south Indian family which has lots of festivals & sweets as part of the custom but i was guided on how to be able to balance it not having to give up completely too. I only wished the doctor was available over WhatsApp too but however she would patiently respond to our queries over mail within a few days. She has a team of nutritionists who would be available over WhatsApp for any day to day queries during working hours. Overall, helped me understand my body, it's nutritional requirement & how to manage it. I hope i'll be able to maintain this in the coming years too.
