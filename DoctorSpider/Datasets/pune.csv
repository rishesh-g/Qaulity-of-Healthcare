Patient friendly doctor.. ,After consulting a lady doctor in posh corporate set up in Shivaji Nagar, our expectations were going down. Luckily after that, in shadows of depression, we rightly consulted Dr. Chittake who gave us rays of hope. He took out time to emotionally consult the couple which is equally important as physical fitness, while our previous doctor counted every second of her consultation time. Rather than relying on previous tests, he preferred doing all the tests newly to see current physical condition as if to start afresh. He has a very calm nature and brings a systematic approach to the table. He never gets irritated to answer patient queries and understands physical and emotional stress that couple is going through. Never passes insensitive comments after seeing worsening of reports. I especially remember days when he did our emotional counselling when I was on verge of emotional breakdown /depression. Now that we’re blessed with a sweet little Baby Girl, we cannot thank enough to doctor who was there for us right from conceiving to delivery. Words are not enough to express our gratitude towards him after going through emotional and physical roller coaster ride. For us, it was a good decision to shift to Dr.Chittake who’s more interested in service than sitting in corporate set up (unlike Cloud Nine).His clinic in Baner is neat, calm and clean.

Would love to visit him again and would highly recommend. ,I visited the clinic with the case of Herniated Spine Disk. Dr Pote explain the symptoms clearly in simple words and potential issue with supposedly Herniated Spine Disk problem and suggested to opt for MRI. The MRI confirmed the diagnosis which was followed by minimal treatment by medicine which did not solve the pain. The doctor suggested to opt for acupuncture for a few weeks which also didn't ease the pain. The next step was to inject local anesthesia with antibiotics to remove/reduce sensations from the affected nerve which worked for a few weeks but couldn't cure it. Finally the Dr suggested to opt for surgery which was quick. I was discharged the next day and opted for one month of bed rest as suggested by the doctor. The doctor was extremely helpful in guiding for insurance claims and other queries before the surgery. Also, there were constant visits for surgery wound status checkup with constant guidance on the status. I was up and running in 30 days and started workout in three months without any post surgery affect. , highly recommended.,Dr. pote was very professional and provided us with all the insight.

Apollo Clinic,Pune,"MBBS, DGO",20,"I am pleased to share review for Dr. Aarti Rapol about her high level of professionalism and command on her subject (Gyanacologist). I got my wife’s IVF successfully executed by her . Only after meeting with Dr. Aarti & getting an appropriate treatment from her at the Sahaydri hospital, we could get the needful results.,I was diagnosed with a very low AMH with very few chances of concieving naturally with my own egg reserve. I was referred to Doctor Aarti who specializes in cases of infertility. From the very first day she has been very frank and honest with us. While IVF would be the first preference in such a case she was not pushy or in a hurry to suggest IVF instead she tried different medications to help things move natural way. The journey has been tough with moments of low when AMH was not increasing. However Dr. Aarti's positive attitude and calm nature helped me stay strong. After trying for 6 months by gods Grace and Dr. Aarti's efforts a miracle happened and I concieved naturally. I am continuing my treatment with her and pray for a smooth delivery of my baby by her.  I highly recommend Dr. Arti for patients with low AMH. What also matters in addition to her treatment is to stay positive and always be hopeful!,Dr Aarti is very patience in listening to ur issues and understands well because of her deep knowledge. She is very friendly n make u feel very comfortable to share what u feel n going through... She is a very good consultant and guide. I am very happy with the way she is taking care of my treatment and giving personal attention. I am lucky to find her when I was depressed and she helped me with positive result. Thank u once again Dr Aarti. ,We are currently consulting Dr Aarti for Infertility Treatment. Its been like 3-4 Months since she is looking at our case. Trust me Dr Aarti is one of those rare doctors who place the patient's interest before anything else. Let me start with beginning how we met Dr Aarti. We have done lot of research over internet before finalizing her. Being newly shifted to Pune, Internet was the only source for us to search for different doctors, go by patients feedbacks, analyse doctor's profile and genuineness. Since there are hundreds of doctors in Pune currently offering  Infertility Treatments but it was hard for us to come to the conclusion. We thought to consult Dr Aarti and took the appointment after going by feedbacks of her simplicity and behavior with patients. For us this was most important factor as we personally think doctor should be patient enough to listen carefully, give proper time, calm the patients and should offer affordable solutions considering the actual problem. Trust me we were not disappointed !! We were simple amazed with her simplicity, caring and humble nature. She calmed us , listened very patiently, gone through the entire past history and gave more than enough time to us. We felt more confident when we realized that she is on top of each and every aspect of our past history. She told us that we will go step by step (unlike other doctors who simply suggest to go with higher end Infertility Solutions before even trying other alternatives). We have consulted other doctors as well who focus more on marketing gimmicks and less on patient's interests but Dr Aarti is simply not like those. In fact one of Pune's very reputed doctor scared my wife and suggested to go with ICSI directly as my wife's AMH count was very low. ",500,Dr. Aarti Rapol,3.5,Gynecologist/obstetrician

I am overweight and 35 years old, which the doctor kept highlighting, so all of this was rather disheartening and stressful.We decided to take second opinion and visited Dr. Mithil. On the very first appointment, he kept a friendly demeanor, explained the whole process in significant detail and assured us of best possible guidance and approach. He kept positivity in us and on looking at the test results, he assured us that all was normal. During the first scan itself, doctor debunked any misgivings the previous doctor had.We decided to go for IUI in my first cycle after meeting Dr. Mithil and lo and behold, I got pregnant with the first attempt. It was a very smooth, pain free and stress free procedure. It was due to meticulous planning and timing. Dr. Mithil coached us very beautifully. Ashiwini Hospital in Balewadi has excellent facilities and a great support staff. I definitely recommend Dr. Mithil for all issues concerning gynaecology, infertility and pregnancy.

For some reason, doctor came at around 11.55 am which delayed the visit more.3. I think booking on practo doesn't have any preference once you reach there. I booked appointment of 11.15 am and booking time was 10 am. which was first slot I think but when I reached there (11 am), my number was 3rd (and I think first 2 bookings were done there directly on desk before I reached there at 11 am but after my booking time 10 am.)I booked the first available slot so that I could finish the appointment on time, but due to above reasons I had to wait for over 1 hour and also it lead to more wait time on other things like blood report and all because by that time, there was so much of rush.So overall, I would recommend the doctor for his way of treating patients but for sure practo should be in sync with hospitals for doctor's visit timing.,Request to make access easy to clinic,no lights in staircase area and difficult to find entrance to clinic from basement,Dr. Bhasme is a good doctor and his treatment also.

Rising Medicare Hospital,Pune,"MBBS, MD - Obstetrics & Gynaecology",14,"The consultation experience was good. Visited to the doctor for Gynae related problems. The doctor's behaviour was good with us. We visited the doctor twice every time when we visit the doctor we can't pay the fees 500rs, every visit we need to pay. They talk or listen to us and the suggestion he gave was good. There is no waiting time to consult the doctor., The suggestion he gave is very helpful but we didn’t want to try now but the things he said are correct looks good. He tells us not to waste time on thinking and making decisions ASAP. His decision making is good.,I have known Dr Amit for more than three years now. I am a male in my early thirties and my spouse is in her late twenties. We chanced upon Dr Amit after wasting our time on more than half a dozen Gynecologists. On the outset, Dr Amit is one of those rarest and almost near extinct group of professionals who has the natural flair to combine knowledge, experience, wisdom and empathy seamlessly into their practice. We met Dr Amit serendipitously and under one sitting it became very clear to us that he is the professional help that we have been looking for all along. Dr Amit has a different approach that's rarely seen in the current generation medical professionals. As we are both working professionals, Dr Amit understood our needs and limitations and offered us a very flexible consulting schedule. During the first few sittings, he spent substantial time understanding our backgrounds, work lives, and lifestyles. He then moved on to study my spouse's physiology and her body's response to dietary and palliative interventions. Under few months, his approach became very clear to us. Dr Amit ruled out potential bottlenecks to my spouse's pregnancy, one at a time. Currently, my spouse has just transitioned into her second trimester of pregnancy. If there's one thing that was systemic throughout the treatment cycle, it is Dr Amit's confidence and his ability to keep us motivated. There were instances where we turned desperate and asked him for artificial interventions. He counseled against such an intervention so early in the treatment cycle and asked us to stay motivated. In my experience, I have seen doctors jumping on the earliest opportunity to perform procedures that were unnecessary and expensive. Dr Amit is a well learnt man and it is my gut feeling that he spends substantial time outside his practice hours reading to keep himself abreast with the developments in his field. I remember him citing interesting scientific studies and statistical approaches to drive home his point. On a side note, I once asked Dr Amit why he charges so less fee for consultation. His response was simple and profound but it got me thinking. He said, he wants to help more people. Professionals with this attitude are poised for long term success. I am writing this review to let those thousands of women and desperate couples like us who are in need of decent professional help know that there is someone out there to help you, provided you are willing and open to seek Dr Amit's advice. My best wishes to Dr Amit and may he live longer to better the lives of people who are in need of serious help. Signing off.,After going from many gynac across Pune, my sister, who was undergoing treatment under Dr Vinod Bharti,. asked me and my wife to pay a visit to Dr Amit Patil. This advise turned to be awesome.

I feel we should have been told by someone of Dr Patil months ago so that we would not be wasting time and energy behind other gynacs.thank you Dr Patil.,we had been fighting from infertility for 2 years and were not able to understand the problem. we had changed multiple doctors as well but no satisfaction.

Dr. Poorva Rocks!!!,A couple of months ago, my brother started experiencing intense earache and noticed that it had affected his hearing ability. So, I booked an appointment via Pristyn care that very day for my brother. The doctor found out that he had erupted a hole in his eardrum and needed to undergo surgery. He got the surgery done after 2 days of consultation. It came as a surprise that he got the surgery date so easily. Although we did not like the diet he got in the hospital but still the overall experience in the hospital was nice.  ,I was feeling pain a firecracker had burst near my ear and in the next few days, I also observed that my hearing ability was getting affected day by day. I literally panicked and started looking for the best ENT doctor in Pune. However, after going through profiles of many doctors, I booked an appointment and visited Dr. Poovra Kale at Pristyn Care clinic in Pimpri. He diagnosed that my eardrum had ruptured and tympanoplasty was needed. I agreed to undergo the surgical treatment but was a little bit scared from inside as well as I have never gone through any surgery in my life. Moreover, to my surprise, Dr. Poovra carried out the surgery painlessly in less than an hour and I was discharged on time. The follow-ups were free, and I faced no problem in reaching out to the doctor whenever I needed his advice.

A Septogenerian Hypertensive COPD Patient with Neck/Skull Pain should be first of all be Checked for the Blood Pressure and Heart & Lungs condition by Stetho in the first Place. And Medication or medical advise should include for his Cholesterol & Prostrate Protection. Only Tablets for B.P & Inhalers for COPD is never a Complete Protection for an Old Setogenerian Patient.

There, we were assigned to the care of Dr.Kundan H.Khamkar. Since then, my father's diabetic condition and overall health has improved remarkably. One late night, a few months back, I had to take my father to the Emergency Ward in the Ruby Hall Clinic, Hinjewadi. It was dark and I was frantic with worry, and did not look around. Dr. Khamkar was just then leaving from the hospital after his visit. He was about to ignite his car when he saw us drive into the hospital. Out of the goodness of his heart, he parked his car and came to check on my father. I saw him walk in and that brought me immense relief. After long years of hunting for a doctor with equal amounts of skill, expertise and humaneness, I finally feel safe for my father's health management. He is very approachable and friendly. With a warm smile on his face, he listens to his  patients with empathy and understanding. When I asked my father as to how he feels about his treatment under Dr. Khamkar, this is what he said, \""I have been diabetic for 35 yrs. During this period, I have consulted a good number of diabetologists. Now I am under the care of Dr. Kundan Khamkar. I can say, without any exaggeration, that Dr.Khamkar is by far superior and much more than what I expected. His hands are healing with a divine touch.

Sahyadri Super Speciality Hospital,Pune,"MBBS, FCPS - Medicine, DNB - General Medicine",15,"Happy with Doctor friendliness Explanation of the health issueTreatment satisfaction,We came here on 27th September 2016 at 12 midnight. My father was suffering from fever since 15 days.casulty doctors admitted him immediately. Dr Kapil visited him in the morning around 10 am. After checking my father he immediately asked to do all necessary tests which included blood and urine test. In between he went through my father's medical history as he is having cardiac related problems. Based on that he observed my father and suggested to do complete checkup and shifting him to Icu for better observation. Yes the days were hard but at the end of the day all the reports were negative which included Csf, city scan, MRI. Meanwhile he already started all the medicines so that whatever the cause is there he will respond to it and fever should go. All the tests were negative :), but the  positive thing was medicine worked and my father started responding to it. Fever was gone. Later there were some complications regarding his bp and heart rate but with the help of medicine he prescribed he got better day by day. My father was in Icu for 6 days. Dr was suggesting that I should let him be in Icu for one more day medically , but with his assurance I gave consent and shifted him to private ward. Later the doctor saw his improvement and discharged him in two days :).,We bought my father in emergency department of Sahyadri at 6am in the morning. He was feeling too weak and was sleepless since 3 days, with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He was also having minor difficulty breathing. Dr. Kapil was our family doctor since 3years so we naturally contacted him and they got my father admitted. After a check up and chest xray Kapil sir immediately termed it as pneumonia and the relevant treatment was started. It could have been be due to swine flu or pneumonia bacteria/viruses is what he suggested, but only tests could prove that. A day after, my father was having too much of coughing and more difficulty breathing, he was moved to icu, where the next xray showed spread of infection in lungs and was put on ventilator. By the time the test reports were out. Swine flu and pneumonia panel was negative. Also, by this time Kapil sir had reviewed reports and stepped up the antibiotics. He also doubted the Dengue which turned out to be positive, but there were no dengue symptoms. The treatment was already started from day one, which helped. Father eventually became stable, xrays were back to normal and he was moved out of icu and discharged in 2days. The cause was later identified to be Dengue driven which had caused the viral Pneumonia. Thanks to the efforts and treatment of Dr. Kapil & team who almost saved my father from the unfortunate circumstances. He explained causes in straightforward words, but was kind enough to console & support us. His understanding of symptoms and correct diagnosis has always helped my family, is much appreciated. ,I visited him with my mom last month where my appointment was @12 and number came @1 where doctor doesn't have any sympathy to patient who were wait him for so long. After very high level examine, he confirmed that my mother is suffering from BP, ,The way he treated us is completely unprofessional.

He will help you with finalising the details of what is needed by being compassionate to listening to your needs and fulfilling the ways for your needs to be met. He is a consummate professional. The clinic is wonderful and relaxing. The staff there would most certainly show to be, personally picked for their lovely attitudes, professionalism and care. He has a great team! The clinic is set in the tropical gorgeously green city of Pune and the clinic itself conveyed that relaxing tranquil tropical and naturistic feel.very different to what Im used to and such a lovely setting.Ashish will discuss with you your needs,exhaustively before,to make sure that you are being pleased in every way and all those needs are met. Really professionalism at its best. The breast surgery was issue free. For my revision rhinoplasty, I set my sights not so much low, but at a very minimum as I understand how complicated it is to go others surgery.  So I requested with fingers and toes crossed, if an elongated bump that had appeared on the right side of my nose from the previous surgery, could be rasped/removed. Ashish went 10 steps further. He suggested that the whole bridge of my nose could be modified to be smaller. And so it was. He went over and above, not just to please my request/needs, but much much further, spending literally several physically tiring and strenuous hours, for him, in surgery. Not only is he masterful at what he does. he won't give you 100%. He will give you 110% or more than what you asked. I am so grateful to him for finalizing,finally, the saga of my not-soperfect nose, over and above what I required. Deep down i had imagined it would not be something that could ever be truly 'fixed' anywhere in the world and that I would have to learn to live with it, but how wrong i was. I would highly highly recommend Dr.Ashish for his skillful ability, his professionalism, his team (especially his colleague and assistant Dr. Madhuri who cared for my needs before and after surgery) and his dedicated and tireless approach to helping people feel good about themselves again. Thank you to Dr.Ashish and all the team for helping me, be able to take pride in my appearance again and regain my lost confidence and esteem.

We are thankful to Shailesh Sir and his team for building confidence to my father. My father's age is 82 years. He told us initially that he wouldn't go for any surgery even if Lord Brahmha tells him. It was surprised for us when he came back at home from Sancheti hospital after consultation with Doctor Shailesh Hadgaonkar and told us that he would like to go for surgery as soon as possible. My sister asked him whom did he mate more powerful than a Lord Brahmha. My father were wearing a smile in that tensed situation also. Jokes apart I just want to mention Doctor Shailesh Hadgaonkar's consultation was so powerful. It was just not the consultation but whatever it was discussed in that consulting room Shailesh Sir was so prepared with all the specialist doctors at the time of operation. It was really tough time for him also where it took more than five hours he was operating. Shailesh Sir didn't forget to come out in between and told us not to worry; everything was under control. All staff of Shailesh Sir is very caring except OPD staff is not that supportive. However management of Sancheti hospital definitely consider your feedback and tries to improve upon your suggestions. Shailesh Sir himself take care of your budget and suggest you a good option via his administrative Manager. Note that it doesn't mean they negotiate. Dr Sai , Dr Jay, Dr Sachin, his lady managers (Sorry I forgot names) are very good team. My father is completely fine now after his spinal surgery.

I was diagnosed with the fracture in the month of October.  In the second visit after the injury (first visit to Doctor Hadgaonkar) doctor had asked me to continue with previous medicines. In the 2nd visit, doctor has advised me to start physiotherapy sessions without recommending me to get an x-ray done (I had lost my first x-ray). Even when I insisted to get the x-ray done, Doctor replied that we will directly get the MRI done and for now I can start with my physiotherapy sessions. ,The time given by the doctor was not more than 2-3 mins to analyse the issue. Very costly MRI and x rays was recommended by him on the first visit. The problem was not explained and only pain killers were provided without any further details of the issue.

He should see new patients ONLY when he can afford the time as, he left in the middle of my  consultation in a hurry and I was left at the mercy of the junior doctor who barely could answer any of my queries. The hospital should have a system in place where they give limited appointments depending on the doctors availability but sadly they don’t. Dr.ajay gave instructions to the junior doctor in a hurry who didn’t remember all of them later. He had asked me to see a specific physiotherapist in my area and the junior doctor completely forgot about it. I had to remind him and he didn’t know the name nor contact details of the physiotherapist! So he had to go and ask dr.Ajay in the next room again! If I want to see a junior doctor I will book an appointment with them. If I’m spending my time / energy/ money to see dr.Ajay Kothari then that’s what I expect to get as I have a very long and complicated medical history. I’m currently following the treatment he suggested but I doubt I would want to visit there again as I don’t want to go through the same dissatisfied experience. I hate hospitals(like everyone) and avoid it even in extreme cases exactly for this reason.

Her suggested medication works excellently. I am writing this review after 3 months, after seeing improvement in my acnes drastically for which i had visited many drs before. Shes a great doctor, understands and analyze the problem, keep record of it and remembers too in the follow up meet 😊,I have been visiting Dr Ritu Choubey for more than 2 years and each of my visit has been pleasant, I have also recommended many friends and colleagues for treatment. My last visit however was very unfortunate as I was not aware about the new system 'by appointment only' was in place as it was my follow up after 3 months. To begin with the staff was rude and made me feel humiliated as I landed without an appointment, when I told her I was not aware as this was something new and shall take appointment from next visit onwards but she was in no mood to consider. I requested her to speak to the doctor since there were only 3-4 patients before me and I have never taken more than 5mins but she gave me a feedback that the doctor will not meet without a prior appointment. Told her I have come from far & that too during office hours as it was a little urgent but she was not ready to budge and I decided to just walk away before being humiliated more. Please teach your staff to show some courtesy towards your patients.,She treats patients like ""patient"" & not like customer. According to my issue, she haven't gave any costly medication or other prescription, she find out the actual cause behind diseases and treated me just by ""vitamins"" injections.

Thank you ,I was new to this city and wasn't keen to visit a dentist here, as finding a good dentist is like finding a needle in a haystack. I was lucky enough to learn about him from an aunt, who had bad experiences elsewhere, but since visiting Lathi Dental Care, she's back to her smiling best. So I decided to pay a visit as I had to get my re-root canal treatment done. I was reluctant at first, but Dr. Alok made me comfortable. I ask a lot of questions, and He explained me basically everything about my issues calmly. ,On allergic testing, it was found that I am allergic to lox. In a renowned hospital I was advised removal of wisdom teeth under GA. I was undergoing every procedure under GA like extraction of a molar six years back. One of my acquaintance strongly recommended Dr. Lathi. So I visited him for a second opinion.,, Dr. Alok performed allergic testing for a different LA. N fortunately it caused no allergic reaction. My wisdom teeth were painlessly removed by him without GA. He took a major load of my mind as the charges were six times lesser than that quoted by the others. He is a genuine human being and thinks from the patients perspective.,It was a nice experience visiting your clinic. Appointment was confirmed according to my convenience.

Synergy Spine and Orthopedic Center,Pune,"DNB - Obstetrics & Gynecology, MBBS",11,"From the day we went for pre-conceptional counselling till the day he did the delivery of the baby, we both were completely guided by Dr. Ulhas Pote. He is an excellent doctor, cared for the baby and my wife like a family, the level of responsibility he expresses can't be defined in words. On his advice we also were convinced about the decision of delivery before the due date and heartiest thanks to Dr. Ulhas Pote we had a very healthy child. Should we had waited till delivery date, baby would have grown overweight and that could have created problem in the delivery for both mother and child. I express my deepest gratitude to you sir, you're an excellent doctor but above all you're a great human, without your guidance things could have been very difficult for us. All the advices and precautions you adviced resulted in a healthy child. For our child , her mother and you are two God's. I've recommended 3 of my friends cum colleagues to meet Dr. Ulhas Pote for pre-conceptional counselling or for any issue in between the pregnancy. ,He has extensive experience in dealing with high risk pregnancy, infertility, gynae oncology and gynae laparoscopy surgeries.There are two special people in everyone's life who are next to God ,one is the mother and other is Doctor Who guides like a mother through the journey of pregnancy. You have been that second most important person in my babies life. Thank you doctor for all the effort you put in and all the advice that you give into it to make it a normal delivery . You kept us updated about all the progress and test we have done during the whole pregnancy period.It's because of acumen of Dr. Ulhas Pote that we are blessed with baby. It was a high risk pregnancy with instrumental delivery but Dr. Ulhas and his team handle it with ease. I would recommend him to all who are experiencing problem in conceiving. Two minutes in his is more informative than half hour discussions with others. His biggest asset is his calming aura- if she is around you know everything will be taken care of. I strongly recommend his as he is a rare find !It was a nice experience here from pregnancy till delivery. I would like to thank doctor Ulhas for my wife successful delivery and guidance throughout the pregnancy. ,We consulted Dr. Ulhas Pote for my first pregnancy and we are really glad to found him. He is very kind and patient. In couple of first visits we knew we were in safe hands. ,Consulted Dr. Pote based on patient's feedback on internet. I had consulted a couple of doctors before him and was highly dissatisfied and stressed. Mostly  doctors dont devote required time to patient and follow their own pre-defined course without considering individual patient's requirement which leads to loss of time and money. I am glad that I consulted him. His treatments are cost effective otherwise many doctos consider patient as money m*king machine. Now with the grace of god I have been blessed with a baby. I wish Pote sir all the success and very healthy life.",400,Dr. Ulhas Pote,4.5,Gynecologist/obstetrician

I was not able to sit or walk even for couple of mins. When I met Dr. Vipul Jain for first time, his analysis was spot on. He is very friendly and understands the problem well. After 2 weeks of treatment (Chirotherapy + Physio), my pain almost went off and I was able to resume my routine again. I appreciate his way of treatment and definitely would like to recommend him.,I was suffering from severe pain in the buttock and calf. I could not walk for more than a few minutes. Hence I consulted a Doctor and did a X-ray along with allopathic medications followed by physiotherapy,IFT and acupuncture for a week. But there was no relief. Then I was asked to do a MRI and the diagnosis was Diffuse Disc bulge(L4-5) encroachment abuts L-5 traversing nerve root. ,Great Physiotherapist, very friendly, transparent, treats with great care and effort. I am truly benefited with the treatment. I have frozen shoulder and for quite a few months I was suffering with pain. I visited multiple doctors and undergone 3 weeks of Physiotherapy earlier, but nothing of much help. Eventually pain increased and right hand movements became more restricted. I was visiting Pune for a month from Kolkata and got to know about Dr. Vipul Jain from Practo. I am so glad that I decided to pay him a visit. He explained in great details about the problem, symptoms, stages, threats and possible treatments. He didn't set any false expectations that I will be healed in a month, but he assured that with treatment & exercises I will feel better and eventually in next few months I can resume normalcy. I admit that the exercises initially were painful but after 3 weeks of treatment I am almost 80% cured, I am slowly getting the strength back and able to do the household chores. I am so satisfied with the treatment that I am recommending the doctor to my friends and family. If Physiotherapy is a cure to your problem, it is worth a visit.,This feedback is just a small tribute to the priceless help I got from Dr. Vipul for my husband who got his knee dislocated in the month of April this year. In the first consultation with him, I realized that he understood the in and outs of what the issue was. He gauged the strength of the affected leg and spotted even the tiniest issue such as the way of walking.  I believe that was the very first step of treating my husband completely as he had tracked down what all needs improvement apart from the injury. Multiple visits that were made by my husband to him has helped him now walk absolutely normally. We feel that Dr. Vipul knows where to focus at what time that helped us heal in the appropriate way. Along with all of this, his way of motivating my husband mentally was remarkable too. Every time we visited him, we got filled with positive energy. We will still continue to visit him so as to eradicate the issue from its roots but in the process I thank Dr. Vipul from the bottom of my heart and wish him great success ahead.",500,Dr. Vipul Jain   (Physiotherapist),5.0,Physiotherapist

She instills confidence into you and all your fears disappear. Her comforting and crisp explaination helps one overcome all surgical fears. I felt at ease knowing I was in good hands! ,I had taken my home help there as she was told by some local doctors that her 5 year daughter had an eye defect that will eventually make her blind. I had a word with Dr Samita Moolani there and immediately got an appointment. So there was a tiny defect which had taken place at birth. There was no threat to her sight what so ever and her eye sight was good so she didn't need spectacles at this point too. They so thoroughly checked her for any issues that could possibly be there. A retina specialist checked the 5 year old the next day and told her not to worry. ",600,Dr. Samita Moolani,5.0,Ophthalmologist

She was concerned about not just focusing on my painpoint, but to strengthen the peripheral muscles and core. While I still work through my pain, she has equipped me with exercises, techniques and approach to manage my situation. I will recommend her as one of the outstanding PTs, considering that many medical practitioners tend to work in silos, while she has a holistic approach, and that is the need of the hour for PT and medical care!,My neck pain subsided greatly after going through the physio sessions done by the doctor and her assistant (Lopa - Thanks!).

Netra Eye Clinic & Retina Laser Centre,Pune,"MBBS, MS - Ophthalmology",18,"My mother ( Mrs.Hamida.S.Jamena ) have recently had cataract removal operations for her left eye from your hospital. These days it is almost impossible to open a newspaper or hear/watch a newscast, without some scandal or serious problem with the NHS being in the headlines.  I therefore take pleasure in commending to your attention, the excellent service provided by the above, particularly Dr.Sachin Bodhale.  All staff were helpful, courteous and professional in the extreme.  Both my mother and I were impressed at the number of checks made before the operations. I must have been asked at least six times what I was there for.  If all departments in all hospitals carry out such checks we simply cannot understand why ""never events"" as I believe they are called, happen at all.  As regards the procedure itself, speaking as someone whose education has been solely in the humanities, I cannot make up my mind whether it is black magic or medicine at the Star Treck level. One can only admire the research and development in several disciplines which must lie behind the procedure, and the skill of the surgeons and other staff involved.  I hope and assume your administrative procedures are such that this letter will be brought to the attention of the staff at the Day Clinic.  ,Around 4 years ago, on suspicion of something wrong in my eye (floaters), I picked the first doctor found on Google Search for diagnosis. I consider myself fortunate that he turned out to be Dr. Sachin Bodhale. He promptly accommodated an appointment for me on the same day, and provided me with a diagnosis (retinal tear) as well as advised me for an immediate non-invasive surgery. I took the advice, and on the same night, he carried it out. I can safely say that he saved my eye. Since then, I have been his patient. His medical acumen is matched by his professionalism and his down-to-earth nature. His personal dedication to his patients is proved from the fact that the surgery was performed at 10pm at night, which is well beyond clinic hours. His availability is proven from the fact that he has no qualms on giving out his mobile number to his patients for any emergency.,Not a worthy doctor. Seems to be a money oriented medical practitioner. I visited his clinic for my mother's glaucoma treatment. He charged double the consultation fees for intraocular pressure checking, which every ophthalmologist is supposed to do for a glaucoma patient.,will not recommend.  doctor charges very high for check up.patient can do bargaining on treatment as rates are very from patient to patient.",350,Dr. Sachin Bodhale,3.0,Ophthalmologist

My Brother lost his life in pain , was not even bothered to ask his condition in the end. DON'T visit him ever.,Dr Nachiket works for various hospitals and clinics on a call basis. I was treated by him at Lifeline hospital and he was called in to perform an endoscopy on me. The entire experience and his behaviour was unprofessional and worrisome. He arrived to the appointment 3 hours late, in a bad mood and started screaming at the hospital staff and also my mother for no reason. He even threw some equipment around the operating room, when he put the camera tube down my throat and stabbed it around my stomach, I could feel everything. I was informed that if I felt any discomfort I should let the doctor know and he would stop. But even after I repeatedly asked him to stop he made a nurse hold me down and continued. The entire ordeal was so bad that after removing the tube from my throat I convulsed and shook for an entire 15 minutes. It was very traumatic and my stomach hurt from the harsh stabbing for days. After all of this when I was recovering in my ward, I was informed I would have to pay to replace the equipment he threw around in the operating room. Would not recommend this doctor to anyone. Negative rating.,What to say about this Dr, very rude. At times blunt while speaking with patient. My mother was under his care for liver cirrhosis, she had mild cirrhosis when diagnosed a year back in Mumbai, after coming to Pune we heard about this Dr from a family frd so went for the first consultation but he was very negative about the outcome (as if he was very sure my Mom won't live any longer) We were doing medicine management under him, but with in a six months my mom's condition got so worsened that he told us, we may have max a year in our hand. After following his medicine management my mother never really felt better, her condition got more and more worsen and finally we had to hospitalize her a couple of times under him in Poona hospital. In last month after being under his supervision for more than two weeks, my mom got too weak and she was in and out CICU but finally we lost our battle and my mom passed away within not even a year under Dr Dubale's care. We Still regret of not taking 2nd/3rd opinion. So all in all, we found him not so professional, very arrogant/rude while talking and not available when someone really needs care/ forget about the emergencies! , Unprofessional, keeps patient's relative in dillema, never disclose truth about patients condition to their relatives , Never ever go to him ,He did endoscopy of my brother , My brother was in ICU from last 2 months and he lost his life, If had it been possible for me, I would have given him negative stars.",500,Dr. Nachiket Dubale,,Gastroenterologist

Pushpsneh Multi-Speciality Clinic,Pune,"MBBS, DGO",26,"Mother of all expecting or would be mother. One of the nicest Doctor one can have during Pregnancy. She is the one who is more with humanity rather than professionalism. If any one of you reading my review is having any kind of health issue...close your eye and trust Smita Ma'am. She will cure not only physically but she will help you overcoming your psychological issue as well. Pregnancy is a lovely phase and if you have a right doctor during pregnancy you are one of the blessed one. I am one of them. She is the doctor who is available 24*7 with answers for all silly questions. she is available on what's app, physically and even on calls. She will make you feel as if you are her kid and she will have a close watch on your diet, health, weight and her confidence on us will make everything possible. I spent my whole 9months under her observation and she is the one who gave my baby girl in my hand. Her confidence in you will boost your mind that anything is possible and once you trust her blindly she will make sure that we achieve what we expected. Not only she treated me but she kept guiding my husband how to take care of me and helped him understanding how to manage my food and lifestyle. She use to guide him how to be careful at which stage and without explaining she never use to ask for test and majority times test and scans which she can do were being done by her. In my whole pregnancy she kept a close watch on me and Touchwood I never had any single issue despite my age being 30+ I did not had BP, Thyroid or any other complicacy in those whole 9months. People say to deliver a baby one should go to her maternal home I would not agree to it..infact one should be at that place where she is being taken care by doctor. I was having an option to go to my maternal place but I decided to stay back in Pune and get my delivery under her. I was so lucky that she only completed my delivery and I was blessed with a baby girl on 27th July. She is a gem of a person...if you are getting yourself diagnosed under Smita Ma'am you are on right track. Just go home and relax and have a sound sleep rest everything will be taken care by her even your husband's training. 😉,If you are looking for a professional, experienced, ethical gynecologist then Dr. Smita dev , .She is one of the few doctors who does not give unnecessary medicines or tests and would let things happen naturally. Most importantly she knows how to take care of pregnant women. She was very clear and even encouraged me to do prenatal yoga and walking which helped me a lot during whole Pregnancy. It is because of her constant assurance that I was very confident and completely trusted her. She is a really good doctor I am 100% satisfied with her treatment .she has very polite nature and the treat her patient in a very homely and friendly. Really so good doctor I have suggested please go there and take a best treatment with Dr. Smita dev, I had normal delivery under her supervision and now visiting her for post delivery care.

I had lost focus - couldn't concentrate on my job. I was always distracted, lost my appetite. I always felt that I had fallen down in a well with no one to pull me up - helpless. I used to see petrifying dreams. My friend pushed me to go and see a psychologist. And to this day, I am thankful that I listened to him and consulted ma'am. She talked with me. Listened to my story, told me that it's okay to commit mistakes because thats how we learn. She gave me positivity. After our very first session, I was able to think that everything's gonna be okay and I can face the situation. Every session gave me strength and positivity - the feeling of being inside a well changed into me getting out of that well. Finally, I was able to tell my parents, got hold of my life. And now I am alright, enjoying and thanking God for this beautiful life. Those two months still haunts me, but I am glad that I met Doctor Anagha Chhatre.

At my first session, I couldn't convey much about what I was going through but Bhagirathi was patient enough to give me time to open up on my own. In a couple of sessions down the line I got comfortable sharing with her about what was bothering me. Not only is she a very good listener, she actually tries to put herself in your shoes to understand what's going in your head. It's been almost 18 months now, and I am at a much better place. I would definitely recommend Bhagirathi to any of my friends or family who needs help.,Gone through toughest time, having trouble in relationship with family, friends and loved ones. Thought everything is gone. But thanks to Bhagirathi ma’am, I was able gather my life and put it on right track. Every session helped me for mental health, and personality too. I got every possible help to be a mentally strong person. Thanks to Bhagirathi Ma’am to bring positivity in my life.,I had gone to Dr Bhagirathi for issues related to Depression. I was in a terrible state when I first approached her. I had been to a psychiatrist and another psychologist before I met her. Being a very skeptical person, I wasnt sure at first if I will like anyone at all. What I like the most about Dr Bhagirathi is that she changes her method of treatment based on how we are. She is such a patient listener and surprisingly I was able to tell her things that I was scared to tell my other therapist. She will never judge you no matter what your past is. She is extremely supportive and you genuinely feel like she is doing this job for the love of humanity and not anything else. I am accepted for who I am today and I know none of this would have been possible if it wasnt for her. I am confident, I have good stable relationship with my friends and family and I am at peace right now and it was all because of her. Thank you ma'am.,The psychologist is very calm and understanding. I was her client for PTSD and depression. She helped me understand my situation, accept it and become a better person. She also guided me to better express myself through art.

Just like finding out the issue, the advice she gives is comprehensive and ideal for whatever problem the patient has. She makes sure the patient is comfortable during the sessions. I find myself looking forward to our weekly sessions. And I feel myself getting better. ,She's a really nice and sweet person who will genuinely care for you and the problems you face. She plays by the book, so I'd recommend her to first timers for sure. Not so sure about people who've been in therapy before, because you might be used to some of these techniques. ,Good communication skills, good listener, and quite patient.",1000,Ms. Tanya Mangwani,,Psychologist
